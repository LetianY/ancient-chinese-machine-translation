"That is certainly a cause for concern," agreed Zhao Yan, "butwe must consider how serious it is.
and if your plan to take Xu province failed, where could you turn?
The emperor showed Zhang Jun's memorial to his attendants, and they all took off their caps and came barefoot to bow before him. They asked to be sent to the Imperial Prison in Luoyang, and they offered all their property for the use of the army.
Huangfu Gui wrote back in his own defence: "In the autumn of the fourth year [of Yanxi: i.e. last year], the western tribes were actively disobedient, and the ancient capital [Chang'an] was in fear and trembling. The courtitself looked anxiously to the west.
28 January 157 - 15 February 158
Ju Yuan went to the prison to make apologies on his brother's behalf, and he returned his own seal and ribbon as Marquis of Dongwu[yang].
Gongxiao caused trouble with our ruler through his own vain ambition, and he brought the consequences upon himself. Personally, I would never raise a weapon against him, but how can I help him to hide?" All accepted the justice of his argument.
The House of Han is lost. They simply do not recognise the meaning of I see a crow which will rest;But upon whose house?"
There was still disorder in theregion: the barbarians were threatening, officials and people had run away to join the tribes, and families with armed retainers gathered troops and plundered everywhere.
He Qi secretly gathered light-armed and agile men and brought them to a hidden pass. They used iron halberds to climb the mountain,then let down a cloth to bring up the men below.
Cheng Yu replied, "That policy was developed in time oftrouble and was never more than a temporary expedient.
"On the other hand, Wei Gu and his fellows have not yet madea public break from the imperial authority. They claim [342] theyare asking for their former master [Wang Yi],
If you extend your generosity to these men, you will be following the will of Heaven."
Dong Zhuo came to Mianchi, and He Jin now became worried. He sent the Counsellor Remonstrant Chong Shao with an imperial order that he should halt.
Later Jiang Ji came with dispatches to Ye, and when Cao Caoreceived him he gave a great laugh, said, "I wanted only to keep thepeople safe from the enemy, but instead I drove them away!" Henamed Jiang Ji Administrator of Danyang.
Only Qian Zhao made sacrifice and wept for grief. Cao Cao admired his loyalty, and recommended him as Abundant Talent.
Provincial and commandery offices followed the lead, and some men who had no connection with the matter nonetheless shared a miserable fate. As a result of this new inquisition, another six or seven hundred people died or were exiled or dismissed or proscribed from office.
Cao Cao cautioned him, "We live at home as father and son, but we attend to affairs as ruler and subject. If anything goes wrong, I shall punish you in accordance with the royal law. Be careful."
Sun Jian replied, "Dong Zhuo opposes Heaven and defies the law. Until I have killed you and all your clan, and shown your heads to the four seas, I shall not be able to die in peace. How can there be alliance with you?"
If good men have their place about him, then every day he will receive good instruction;but if bad men are permitted in his company, then every day they will encourage his evil traits.
There was constant turmoil in the court at this time, and law and order were poorly maintained. Li Ying, however, retained his composure and his sense of proper administration and integrity. Such was his fame that gentlemen who were received and interviewed by him were described as having "climbed the Dragon Gates."
"Moreover, there are great numbers of concubines in the palace, consuming food with no work to justify themselves. They are bad for [normal] life and they waste the resources of the state.
Lü Bu then took the edict-block from his breast and used it to take command of the troops, saying, "The order requires that Dong Zhuo be executed, and that is all. For the rest, there are no questions asked."
Zhou Yu came out to welcome him, but said immediately, "Youmust be tired, Ziyi, for you have travelled a [408] long way acrossrivers and lakes. Was it just to be a mouthpiece for Master Cao?" Then he escorted Jiang Gan all around the camp. They lookedat the granary and the stores, the arsenal and the accounts of armourand weapons.
The Colonel Who Settles Majesty, Lu Xun of Wu commandery, said to Sun Quan, "At the present time we need a great many soldiers if we are to defeat the enemy and settle disorder. Sheltered in deep and difficult country, the hills bandits have long been a source of trouble.
Besides, I used to serve General Liu and now I serve you.If I leave here one day and then later I curse you, would that beright?" Lü Bu, ashamed, gave up the idea.
while he did not appoint civil officials, but all weregoverned by Libationers.
On the day bingwu [5 Feb] the Marquis of Xinfeng, Shan Chao, died.He was granted funerary items from the imperial workshops of the Eastern Garden, and in his coffin he had adornments of jade.His funeral cortege was escorted by cavalry from the five regiments [of the Northern Army], and the Court Architect supervised the raisingof the tumulus.
After a few weeks Lü Bu was in serious trouble. He called fromthe wall to one of Cao Cao's men, "If you do not force me todesperation, I shall surrender to your excellent master."
If you are ever going to use the people of Wu and Yue against the power of central China, then the sooner the better. If you cannot manage it, then why have you not restrained your troops, curbed your armed men, and faced north to serve Cao Cao?
Cao Pi held that,"The case of Tian Chou is the same as that of Ziwen refusing official salary, or Shen Xu fleeing from wealth.We should appreciate his feelings and not force him to accept."
He served Dong Zhuo while hiding his feelings, and Dong Zhuo treated him well and trusted him.
Following up this success, the men went forward by land and water. They came to the walls, attacked them with all their might, and so they stormed the fortress.
Now Dou Wu and Chen Fan were loyal and upright, but they did not receive your imperial clemency, and that is the source of these evil omens. As a matter of urgency,
Cao Cao had sent Xiahou Yuan and Zhang Liao to besiege ChangXi [at Tan city] in Donghai. After several months their supplieswere exhausted, and they were considering whether they shouldwithdraw their troops.
Heaven has never ceased its abundant attentions to Great Han, and for this reason it has repeatedly produced manifestations and signs to serve as warning or punishment. Its intention is that the ruler should receive the influence, and should change his policy from one of danger to hat of safety.
Han Zhong withdrew to the citadel, but he was frightened and asked to surrender.
Han Sui asked to see Cao Cao face to face. The two men hadknown one other in the past, and now they met on horseback and talked for a while. There was no mention of military matters, theyspoke only of old times in the capital, [426] joining hands andlaughing in pleasure.
Chen Fan and Dou Wu were in complete accord and worked together to support the imperial house. They recommended famous and worthy men from every part of the empire, men such as Li Ying, Du Mi, Yin Xun and Liu Yu. All took place at court and shared in the affairs of government.
King Cao of WEI appointed Pei Qian, Junior Clerk in the Department of Granaries under the Chancellor, as a new Admini strator. He offered him good soldiers,
As more enemy horsemen gradually came up, Sun Jian calmly left his seat and led his men back into the city. Then he explained, "The reason I did not get up straight away was that I was afraid the soldiers would rush and trample one another, and you would not be able to get in."
By this time Cao Cao had already reached Wan, and Liu Bei was surprised and greatly alarmed.You people did this, he said to Song Zhong, "and you gave me not a word of warning. Now, when disaster has come, you at last let me know. Isn't that the limit!"
"Yuan Shao uses fine talk and ceremony to attract men ofgood repute, and many scholars who love words and orna mental show will turn to him.
The Yellow Turbans of Runan defeated the Administrator Zhao Qian at Shaoling.
In the summer, in the fourth month on the day xinhai [25 May] there was a fire in the Eastern Office of Kangling.
People sang and danced in the streets, and the shops in the city were filled with men and women selling pearls and jade, dresses and clothing, to buy wine and meat for celebration.
The emperor asked, "What do they want to do that is outside the law?"
On the day gengshen [1 Jan 196?] the emperor came out [from Caoyang] and went east. Dong Cheng and Li Le guarded the imperial carriage, Hu Cai, Yang Feng, Han Xian and the Worthy King of the West of the Xiongnu were in the rear as guards.
Other officers said, "We climb the bank to attack theenemy, and we wade in the water to board our ships; what use areland defences?" "Soldiers may win or lose," argued Lü Meng, "and no-one canbe a hundred per cent certain of success in battle. Should somethingunexpected happen, and the enemy press us closely, and our menhave not time to reach the shore, how will they get into their ships?" "Excellent," agreed Sun Quan. So he built the Ruxu Fortress.
The possibilities of victory and defeat rest on this day!"
"Though Yang Feng is brave, he is not very clever. He will notsuspect anything, and will agree to the plan by return of courier. Heis not a problem."
Dong Zhuo had false accusation made that the Minister of the Guards Zhang Wen had been in contact with Yuan Shu.In the winter, in the tenth month on the day renxu [5 Nov] Zhang Wen was flogged to death in the market-place to fulfil the prophecy.
At that time a fire from heaven burnt the city [of Mianzhu] and Liu Yan shifted his government to Chengdu. An ulcer broke out on his back and he died.
When Poison Yu heard of it, he abandoned the attack on Dongwuyang and withdrew.
Their statements implicated more people: the Minister Coachman Du Mi of Yingchuan, the Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk Chen Xiang, and men such as Chen Shi and Fan Pang, more than two hundred altogether.
They stormed thecity, cut off Li Shu's head and exposed it. His forces, more thantwenty thousand men, were taken over and transferred elsewhere.
Wang Yun had no alternative but to go down and see them.
Liu Bei was at Fankou, and every day he sent patrols along the river to watch for Sun Quan's army.
Since the time of the Yongchu period [107-113], many military commanders have been sent out on campaign, and five armies have been completely defeated.26 The cost has been counted in the billions, and the supply carts that were brought back [laden with treasure] have been sealed up intact and taken into the houses of the great families.Those generals nonetheless achieved a reputation, they were respected for their good work, and they were granted generous rewards and enfeoffments.
Before this, the Gentleman at the Yellow Gates Xun You, the Master of Writing Zheng Tai, the Palace Attendant Chong Ji and others had made plans,saying, "Dong Zhuo is conceited and cruel, with no allies or friends he can trust. Though he relies on his strong army, he is only one man, and he can be killed with a single blow."
Hou Wen was beaten fifty times, and after that everyone got full measure.
Though Su Fei's crimes are indeed worthy of death, I beg you to let him keep his head."
Cao Cao now regretted that he had brought Pei Qian back so soon,
When he came back he asked, "I was pursuing a retreating armywith good soldiers and you said I would suffer a loss. I attacked avictorious army with defeated men and you said that I would win.
The imperial ancestraltemple and the national altars were established for the first time atXu city.
My successor will certainly think I was too strict, and will treat them more gently.
Zhang Rang brought complaint to the emperor, and the emperor summoned Li Ying and reprimanded him for not having asked permission before carrying out the execution.
When that is done, let the empire decidethe rights and wrongs. Surely that is the honourable way to behave."
It is obvious that his strength is almost exhausted. The decisivemoment is approaching, and this is the time to surprise him. Do notmiss your chance."
Liu Biao sent Huang Zu to go secretly by night to gather reinforcements, but as he was on his way back Sun Jian faced and fought with him. Huang Zu was defeated and fled into the Xian hills.
They went back to drink and feast, and he showedJiang Gan his attendants, and his objects of ornament and pleasure. Then said Zhou Yu, "In all the world, I have found the onemaster who understands me. Outwardly, we behave with the formal ities of ruler and subject, but inside we are joined as blood-brothers.He approves anything I suggest and he always agrees to my plans.In fortune or misfortune, we share it. If Su Qin or Zhang Yi wereborn again, could they change my feelings?" Jiang Gan simply laughed, and did not raise the subject again.
Before they arrived, he wanted to let Shen Pei know his move ments, and he sent his Registrar Li Fu of Julu to go ahead into thecity.
Yuan Shu at one time promised he would make Sun Ce the Administrator of Jiujiang, but then he changed his mind and appointed Chen Ji of Danyang.
Hu Shuang held on to the horse and continued his protest.Li Su killed him and rode away.
If you leave them and go out, however, there willbe no strong guard and the fortress at Yi will fall immediately."
As the emperor arrived, Li Jue had all the gold and silk of the imperial treasury transferred to his own camp, and he set fire to the palaces and apartments, the offices and the people's houses. Everything was destroyed.
There is no way that a son can dismiss his mother, any more than a subject can dismiss his lord! The dowager must be buried with her late husband in the Xuanling tomb. This will be in full accord with the regulations of former times."
Before they have gathered their forces, go quickly to attack Wu Lan.
Lu Zhi, General of the Household of the North, had attacked Zhang Jue and defeated him in one battle after another, and had killed or captured more than ten thousand men. Zhang Jue and his followers fled to take refuge in Guangzong.
Let us promise Sun Quan to keep it quiet, but let the news out privately.
Now I am old, andyou want me to say something disloyal?"
The city surrendered and Cao Cao led hisarmy back to the Ao Granary.
Before this, when Yuan Shao and Cao Cao were raising troopstogether [against Dong Zhuo in 190], Yuan Shao asked Cao Cao, "Ifthis affair should fail, what territory would you take?"
but Cao Cao now controls Jing province and all its territory.Liu Biao had a well-trained fleet, with thousands of armoured boats and other ships of war. If Cao Cao sails all this along the Yangzi and supports it with foot-soldiers, he will be coming against us by land and water."In other words, Cao Cao controls the line of the river as well as we do, and in sheer military strength we have nothing to match him.
Someone spoke to Liu Zhang against Pang Xi, and Liu Zhangbecame suspicious of him.
At this, the emperor shook with rage. He sent orders to the commanderies and kingdoms that they should arrest all men of Faction, and he ordered proclamation made to all the empire so that his wrath might be known and the cause of his anger understood.
He held a great banquet, raised a toast to Xu Huang and said, "It was your good work that saved Fan and Xiangyang."
Chen Fan sent in a memorial, "Now the capital district is in turmoil and the streets are full of shouting and hubbub.People say that Hou Lan and Cao Jie, Gongcheng Xin, Wang Fu and Zheng Li, together with the Lady Zhao [Rao the wet-nurse] and other members of the harem staff are bringing the empire into disorder. Those who support this group rise and prosper, those who oppose them come to harm. The ministers at court are like trees in the Yellow River, drifting east or west. They do nothing but draw their salaries and seek to avoid trouble.
Then Lu Fan went out, changed his ordinary clothing for riding costume, took up a whip, and went below the council hall to report for duty as Chief Controller. Sun Ce gave him tallies and credentials and put him in charge of all administration in the army.
Cao Cao, moreover, is extremely good at usingsoldiers, and you can never tell what he will do next.
Dou Wu would not agree. He gave orders for Shan Bing, together with Yin Xun and the Imperial Clerk Zhu Jin, to examine Zheng Li by various methods, and his confession implicated Cao Jie and Wang Fu.
As the inspectors and administrators also took personal commissions, the people groaned under the burden.
Gao Rou, a Junior Clerk in the Department of Granaries,objected, "If a major force goes west, Han Sui and Ma Chao willsuspect we intend to attack them, and they will join together todefend themselves.
The eunuch leaders took He Jin's head and tossed it to them: "He Jin planned to rebel; he has been executed."
The people of Jian'an, Hanxing and Nanping made trouble; eachdistrict had more than ten thousand men.
Wang Fu was confirmed in his recent appointment as Regular Attendant and Prefect of the Yellow Gates.
Before this, Zhou Yu had been the friend of Sun Ce, and Sun Quan'smother always told him to treat Zhou Yu as an elder brother.
Guan Yu also sent detachments to besiege the General Lü Chang at Xiangyang.
He said to Zu Lang, "You attacked me once in thepast, and chopped the saddle of my horse.
As they returned, however, Jia Xu was on the city wall and hesaid to Zhang Xiu, "Go back after him at once. If you fight this timeyou are sure to win."
Guo Tu and Xin Pingagreed.
"That is not what I meant, "replied Zheng Tai. "I do not believe, however, that there is any need to send a large army against the east of the mountains.
Do you think you're more valuable than Zhuang Jia?" Xin Zeng and the others were frightened, and they followed him.
Some of them ran away and were not caught, so rewards were advertised, and messengers were sent out after them, one following another, to every part of the empire.
"Furthermore, if one man kills another he forfeits his life, and itis fitting, in accordance with the ancient institutions, that he shouldreceive harsh punishment. Sometimes, however, in a case of wound ing, though the criminal may have destroyed a man's body, hesuffers no more than having his hair cut off and his beard shaved.This is not the right pattern.
Guo Tai was a man of wide learning, extremely good at debate.
The provincial headquarters had previously been at Shouchun, but Yuan Shu had occupied that city, so Liu Yao arranged to go south across the Yangzi, where Wu Jing and Sun Ben received him and set him up at Qu'a.
Yang Ci was the son of Yang Bing.
In wisdom alone was the Founder of Han [214] superior to Xiang Yu; and though Xiang Yu was strong he was taken in the end.
so Zhou Yu presented him with a great house beside the road. He went there to pay respects to Sun Ce's mother, and they shared everything together.
His younger brother JuZong said, "Cao Cao's men and horses are no match for ours. Whyare you afraid?"
In the twelfth month, on the day jisi [16 Feb 185] there was an amnesty for the empire and the reign-title was changed [to Zhongping].
In the autumn, in the eighth month Cao Cao attacked Zhao Duand his associates and killed them.
Liu Zong's officer Wang Wei said to him, "Cao Cao has heard that you are surrendering and that Liu Bei has run away. He will certainly relax his precautions, and will come to you with only a light escort.
Wei Yu found out about it, however.He put Ren Fang under arrest, and sent him in bonds to Luoyang.
They were fewer than six hundred in number, but they charged at speed,they completely defeated the enemy, and they took Wen Chou'shead.
His commander Gao Shun objected, "Your name and yourauthority are well-known and respected everywhere. How can youask for something and fail to obtain it? Yet you are going in personto seek a gift. If for some reason you are not successful, you willsurely lose face." Lü Bu would not agree.
Later, Zhang Lu attacked and occupied Ba commandery. Thecourt was not strong enough to fight him, so he was given title asGeneral of the Household Who Maintains the [307] People in Peace, and was also appointed Administrator of Hanning.14 He sentup tribute, but that was all.
In the sixth month on the day xinhai [7 Jul] the Dowager Dong died suddenly from grief and fear.
He made plans with Yuan Shao to kill the favourites. Jian Shi became concerned about this, and he sent He Xun away to serve as Intendant of Jingzhao.
The emperor once asked his Palace Attendant Yang Qi, "How do I compare with Emperor Huan?"Yang Qi replied, "Your majesty resembles Emperor Huan in the same manner as Yu-Shun compares in virtue with Tang-Yao."
Du Shang calculated that if he treated his men leniently they would refuse battle, and if he tried to force them they would simply run away.
The empress was a woman from a butcher's family in Nanyang. She had been brought into the harem by selection, and then bore the emperor a son, Liu Bian. It was for this reason she was made empress.
Li Le said, "The situation is serious. Your majesty should get on a horse."
He brought a great number of the celebrated gentlemen of the empire to appointment: both Chen Fan and Li Xian, his former subordinates, had risen to share in his rank as excellency.
If I surrender to Cao Cao, he will send me back to my home district, to be graded for name and rank, and at the very least I would become a junior Assistant Officer. So I would ride in a carriage drawn by oxen, with an escort of soldiers, and could mingle with the gentry. Then I would be promoted and in the end I would be sure to finish with a province or a commandery.
Lu Su wrote to Liu Bei, "Pang Shiyuan is not the man tomanage a hundred li,
But it would be better to die than act dishonourably."
So he marched, sending Zhang He as advance guard with five thousand horse and foot.
When Liu Yu saw Zhang Qi and his colleagues, he rebuked them sternly, "The empire has fallen into disorder, and the ruler is driven into exile. I have received great favours from the throne, but I have not yet been able to clear away the disgrace from our state.
Cao Cao has cut down his most dangerous rivals, and has settled almost all of them. Now he has overwhelmed Jing province, and his authority makes the four seas tremble.
He was brave and gallant, and as he grew to maturity he became an increasingly fine scholar. He was particularly good at strategy and schemes, and for that I would put him equal to Zhou Yu; only in argument and debate did he fall short.It was Lü Meng who planned the destruction of Guan Yu, and in that he was better than Lu Su.
Zijing [Lu Su] was introduced to me by Zhou Yu. I spoke with him at a banquet and he talked of the great plan for imperial rule. This was one thing that caused me pleasure.
Dong Zhuo said to Huangfu Song, "The situation of Chencang is extremely perilous, I ask permission to go quickly to its relief."
All other members of the Liang and Sun clans, inside and out, were arrested and sent to the imperial jails, then suffered public execution.No consideration was given to age or youth.Of others who were implicated, excellencies, ministers, colonels, provincial inspectors and other senior officials, scores of them died.
Cao Cao summoned He Kui of Chen state to appointment as aSenior Clerk, and asked him about Yuan Shu. "If a man seeks thesupport of Heaven," replied He Kui, "he must follow Heaven's will.If he wishes to receive the assistance of men, he must be worthy oftheir trust.
Take advantage of the north erners' preoccupations, attack Huang Zu and drive him away, goforward against Liu Biao, then seize the full length of the LongRiver [the Yangzi]. Here is the task for a king."
Before this, after the Dowager Dou had been appointed empress, the emperor saw her very rarely, while the Chosen Lady Tian Sheng and others received his favours.
So Yuan Shao divided Ju Shou's authority and appointed threeChief Controllers, with Ju Shou, Guo Tu and Chunyu Qiong eachcommanding one army.
If I did as you request, I should be acting like a common fellow, and what would you think of me then?"
Guan Yu sent messengers several times to Lü Meng to exchange news, and Lü Meng treated them most generously. He took them around the city, and each household sent word [to their relatives with Guan Yu's army]; some wrote in their own hand to show it was trustworthy.
Cao Cao now crossed the Yellow Riverand laid siege to Shequan.
"Even when Zhang Jue has been beheaded and his followers have changed their clothing and submitted to law and order, your servant will still be anxious that things may get worse.
Buildings and mansions constantly increase, filled with clever toys and unusual trinkets. oppressed by fierce [60] punishments the people are forced to dig into the mountains, quarrying out stone for the work.
Dong Zhuo replied, "You may be high officials, but you have failed to keep good order and the emperor himself is a refugee. What is this nonsense about withdrawing troops?"
Only Zhi Xi went and looked after the body, saying, "If Wenju has left me and is dead, what have I to live for?"
4: 187 AD
Zhao Wen the Excellency over the Masses, Wang Jiang the Minister of Ceremonies, Zhou Zhong the Minister of the Guards and the Director of Retainers Guan Ge were captured by Li Jue. He was about to kill them, but Jia Xu said, "These are great ministers, how can you harm them?"
Moreover, the people of this commandery have held loyal, and evenin time of danger they have never been uncertain. I believe the stateshould be showing some consideration, but we still impose the silktax. What sort of encouragement is that?"
Zhou Shen would not agree, but led his whole army to besiege Yuzhong city. Bian Zhang and Han Sui sent soldiers out to camp at Kuiyuan Gorge, and they cut Zhou Shen's supply lines instead. Taking fright, Zhou Shen abandoned his baggage train and fled.
In the summer, in the fourth month Cao Cao came to Ye.
When the libation was complete he would leave his card and depart, and he did not seek to call upon the chief mourners.
As Dong Zhuo came to the Park of Illustrious Light, he saw fires rising in the distance. Realising there was a revolt, he led his troops quickly forward and reached the west of the city before dawn.Hearing that the emperor was in the north, he went with the excellencies and ministers to receive him below the Beimang Slope.
When he had finished Sun Quan had him get dressed again, then took him by the arm and wept, saying, "Youping,you are my brother. In time of war, with no thought for your own safety, you fight like a bear or a tiger. You have been wounded scores of times and your skin is like an engraving. It is only natural that I hold you in my heart with the affection of a close kinsman, and you surely deserve your high command."
Zhu Zhen was most brutally tortured, but he preferred to meet death rather than speak, and so Chen Yi was able to escape.
Then he suddenly gave orders for Xun Yu to be kept in hiscompany, with position as Palace Attendant, Household Counsellorbearing the Staff of Authority, and Adviser to the Army of theChancellor.
Liang Ji had held control of the government for almost twenty years, and his authority was recognised both inside [the palace] and out.The emperor's hands were tied, and he could take no action of his own.He was increasingly dissatisfied with this situation, and when Chen Shou died he was even more angry.
In the summer, in the fourth month Ma Teng was made General Who Gives Tranquillity to the Northern Barbarians and Han Sui was made General Who Gives Tranquillity to the Submissive.
Each year the Shanyu was allotted floss-silk, silken cloth, cash and grain like a marquis, and his sons and grandsons inherited the title.
He beat a drum to lead the men in attack, and the battle waswon.
Wei Gu and his associates sent several thousand soldiers toblock the Shan Crossing, and when Du Ji came up he was held therefor several months.
Lu Bu's officers Xue Lan and Li Feng were camped at Juye, and Cao Cao attacked them. Lu Bu went to aid Xue Lan, but he failed to break through and was compelled to retreat. Cao Cao cut off the heads of Xue Lan and his followers.
Liu Bei would sleep with these two men in the same bed and he treated them with the affection of brothers, but if there were others about they would stand in attendance all day. They followed Liu Bei everywhere, and would undertake anything for him, no matter how difficult or dangerous.
Jia Xu went to call upon Liu Biao, and wastreated as an honoured guest.
Then they all said, "This must have been Xu Ruzi."
The "five marquises" [Shan Chao, Xu Huang, Ju Yuan, Zuo Guan and Tang Heng] were particularly greedy and lawless, and the repercussions [of their abuse of power] were felt both at the capital and in the provinces.
4: 175 AD
He said to Zuo Yuan, "In former times, Yan Zhuoju was the great bandit of Liangfu, and Duangan Mu was a broker in Jin.In the end, however, one became a loyal minister of the state of Qi, and the other was a famous worthy of the state of Wei.
As soon as it was light, Chunyu Qiong and the others saw how fewmen Cao Cao had with him, and they set out their line of battlebefore the gates of the camp. Cao Cao attacked at once. ChunyuQiong retreated to the shelter of the camp, but Cao Cao followed upand attacked him again.
For my own part, I have simply returned to my home country.I have impeached commandery administrators, I have broken up personal connections and family relationships, and I have put old friends to death and shame.It is not surprising that so many people have conspired to malign and slander me.
Because of hisgreat reputation in the empire, Cao Cao pretended to be tolerant and agreeable, but he thoroughly disliked it.
So Cao Cao sent Cao Ren with cavalry to attack Liu Bei. Hedefeated him and drove him away, took back control over all thecounties that had rebelled, then returned.
The ditch about Guan Yu's headquarters had ten rings of abatis, but Xu Huang pursued Guan Yu into his defences and defeated him. Fu Fang and Hu Xiu both died.Then Guan Yu broke off the siege and retreated. His fleet, however, still controlled the Mian River, and Xiangyang remained isolated with no communication to the outside.
In this year the emperor ordered a market set up in the harem apartments and had all his women trade there. They robbed and fought one another, and the emperor dressed as a peddler, joined the crowd and drank wine and feasted with them.
Yuan Shu asked provisions from Chen, but Luo Jun refused.Furious, Yuan Shu sent retainers to kill Liu Chong and Luo Jun bytreachery. So the state of Chen was destroyed.
and your majesty recognised him and appointed him, so that he held position among the Three Excellencies. "But then he suffered false accusation from the Director of Retainers Yang Qiu, and was brought to death while his family was banished far away. All the empire was miserable and disappointed, and worthy ministers felt cheated of their hopes.
"But now [we have these] petty fellows, of false and empty quality, with no essential relationship of flesh and blood, who never received any personal favour [from the late ruler]. They are, moreover, quite without the real quality [suitable for] official appointment, and they lack the proper natural sympathies. There is no way in which [these appointments] can be justified."And there are even criminals amongst their number.
Zhang Song the Attendant Officer of Yi province was a closefriend of Fa Zheng. He was confident of his own abilities, and he too felt that Liu Zhang did not appreciate him, so he was privatelydiscontented.
Then Guo Huai set a firm guard to show he had no intention of retreating, and sent a report of the situation to King Cao of WEI.
Zhao Yan sent in a secret report, urging that "Someone must go to [Cao Cao's] headquarters and ask for experienced and reliable troops to garrison the lands within the passes."
Zhang Ji received and cared forthe refugees, and restored the county cities. The people loved him.
Cao Cao had just lost Yan province, his army's provisions were exhausted, and he was prepared to accept the offer.Cheng Yu said, "It appears, general, that you get flustered under pressure. How else could you be contemplating such a foolish move?
The following morning, however, MaChao's soldiers saw his tracks, and they chased him and caught him.
but Cao Caogave handsome rewards, saying, "When I set out on that expedition, I took risks in the hope of good results.
Fan Pang's mother replied, "Your name now ranks with those of Li and Du. Even if you die for it, how can one have regret?Those who achieve a glorious name, cannot also expect a long life."
A moment later troopers came up from both sides and they broke off their fight.
5: 176 AD
Your majesty has inherited dominion from the restoration of Han, and you maintain the rule of Emperor Guangwu.You hold court and you attend to government, but you have not yet made full use of your sage-like understanding.
With the authority of his imperial commission, however, Chong Shao rebuked them angrily and sent them away in confusion. Then he faced Dong Zhuo and accused him directly of disloyalty. Dong Zhuo apologised, and he led his army off to Xiyang village.
Sun Ce said to him, "Your reputation forvirtue has long been respected and people everywhere admire you. Iam still young, and should act as a son or younger brother."
Take the opportunity to arrestthem, go forward and take over their command, then turn againstChengdu. This is the second-best plan.
Sun Quan was most impressed, and he discussed the matterwith his ministers.
"Since Cao Cao has destroyed LiuBei," observed Tian Feng, "the area about Xu city will no longer beundefended.
Xun Shuang and the others all feared Dong Zhuo's cruelty and none dared refuse.
The Master of Writing Liu Na said, "When a man is acting as a pillar of the state, but offers no support in time of danger, what use is he?"
Chen Ji was the son of Chen Shi, Han Rong was the son of Han Shao.
and King Cao of WEI was even thinking of shifting the capital from Xu city to avoid his attacks.Sima Yi, however, Major to the Army of the Chancellor, and the Junior Clerk in the Department of the West Jiang Ji both said to him, "Yu Jin and his comrades were destroyed by floods, they were not defeated in battle, and there not yet any real damage to the great plans of our state.
Wang Lie did hear of this, and he sent someone to thank the man and present him with a bolt of cloth.
Wang Rui, however, had quarrelled with the Administrator of Wuling, Cao Yin, and he announced that his first priority was to kill Cao Yin.
Jiang Xu's mother was deeply touched. "Quite right, Boyi!" sheexclaimed. "When Commissioner Wei came to harm, that was alsoyour responsibility, not just Yishan's."What man does not die? And to die for loyalty and for honour,that is something worth while.
Then he sent a detachment of seven thousand under the command of Tian Yan, Xia Yu and other officers, all with gags in their mouths, on a night march to climb the mountains on the west [of the valley], where they set camps and dug ditches about one li from the enemy. And he also sent the Major Zhang Kai and others, with three thousand men, to climb the mountains to the east.
The AttendantOfficer of Yang province, Jiang Ji of Chu state, spoke secretly to theInspector, pretending he had received a letter from Zhang Xi to saythat forty thousand horse and foot had already reached Xulü.
Cao Cao had sent Zhao Yan to accompany Xu Huang as Consultant and Adviser to the Army of Cao Ren. Though the other units had not arrived and Xu Huang's command was too small to break the siege, his officers kept urging him to hasten to Cao Ren's relief.
"I believe that this commandery should come under the rulesfor distant areas and new states, so that minor affairs among thepeople are dealt with by chiefs and civil officials according tocircumstance. Above, such a policy will follow the correct model,and below it will accord with the feeling of the people.
"When I first met Yuzhou [Liu Bei] at the Chang Slope, his forces were no more than a colonel's command, he was at the end of his resources and he was desperately worried. His hopes were down, his power was weak, and he was planning to creep off and go far away. He had totally lost heart.
Zhang Zhao constantly received letters from scholars and gentry in the north, full of praise for him, but not for his associates. When Sun Ce heard about this, he laughed, "In olden times Master Guan [Zhong] was Chancellor in Qi. In one thing it was Father Zhong, in two it was Father Zhong, but it was Duke Huan who became the most distinguished of the hegemon rulers.
So he is using sick and weary men to control an army with possible disaffection. Even though he has great numbers, there is nothing to be worried about.
In the winter, in the twelfth month the Grand Commandant Duan Jiong left office.
When he came to the execution ground he swore at theman with the axe and demanded to be allowed to face north, saying,"My master is out there."
The emperor appointed him General of the Household Who Routs the Xianbi.Many leading ministers did not agree, and a conference was called so that all officials to discuss the question in the court.
"A man who cannot be satisfied," remarked Cao Cao, "will get Long and look to Shu."
In the autumn, in the seventh month, Zhang Xiu gathered his followers to make rebellion and they raided the commanderies and counties. The people of that time called them the Rice Rebels.
Before this, when Huang Qiong was maintaining private tuition at his own home,
"The Attendant of the Yellow Gates Zhao Jin, and that great rascal Zhang Fan and his people, all acted with cruelty and greed, but curried favour with your attendants.
If Du Shang is not summoned, I shall bury myself here in this prison cage. I shall never consent to a meaningless release. As long as I live, I shall bear witness to this injustice."
The Colonel Dian Wei fought against Zhang Xiu. Almost allthe men about him were killed or wounded, and he himself was hit ascore of times.
Li Fu realised the guard outside would be tighter and that hewould not be able to play the same trick again. He asked Shen Pei tosend out all the old people and the weak from the city as a means tosave food.
King Qiao asked Qian Zhao, "Once before, Lord Yuan said thathe held command from the Son of Heaven to appoint me Shanyu.Now Lord Cao is saying that he will tell the Son of Heaven andhave me made Shanyu properly. And besides this, there is an envoywith insignia from Liaodong.
Yuan Shao ordered those military officers at Luoyang who were expert in strategy to investigate the eunuchs, and he encouraged Dong Zhuo and the other commanders to send in memorials post-haste, asking permission to bring their troops forward to the Lodge of Tranquil Joy.
So Yuan Shao took over as Governor of Ji province. He claimed the authority to appoint Han Fu as General Who Displays Majesty, but Han Fu had no command and no staff.
"The best policy now is to bring Jing province to join Cao Cao.He will certainly treat you with respect and favour, you will enjoyfortune and honour for a long time to come, and you will be able tohand it on to your descendants. This is the perfect plan."
Cao Cao wanted to go in person to attack Liu Bei, but his officersall advised him, "It is Yuan Shao who is fighting you for the empire,and he may make his move any time. If you turn east, and he comesin behind you, what happens then?"
Yuan Shu had sent Sun Jian to attack Dong Zhuo, but before he returned Yuan Shao appointed Zhou Ang of Kuaiji as Inspector of Yu province, and Zhou Ang attacked and captured Sun Jian's basecamp at Yangcheng.
Zhang Wen sent Zhou Shen to pursue the rebels with thirty thousand men.
Helian's son Qianman was still a child, so Helian's nephew Kuitou took the throne.
The Xianlian and other tribes all respected his authority and good faith, and more than a hundred thousand agreed together to accept his words and came to surrender.
Your majesty's achievements and virtue, how truly imposing! Everyone looks to you. That is why Sun Quan, far away, calls himself your subject.
"I deeply regret that I never had the opportunity to explain[myself to Liu Yao] while he was alive.
Unless we put some short-term strain upon the people now, we can never hope for a long-lasting peace.
Liu Bei felt that Lu Bu's speech and conduct were inappropriate. Though he pretended to approve, privately he was quite put off.
Kong Rong,however, argued that, "Ma Midi had high position [as Grand Tutor]even above the excellencies, and he bore the tasselled Staff ofAuthority on an imperial mission. Yet he went out of his way tocurry favour with wicked ministers, and he permitted such people tocontrol him. He was a great officer of the imperial house, and howcan we accept the excuse that he was forced to act as he did? "The emperor may mourn his former servant and have pityupon him, and he may not wish to inflict posthumous punishmentupon him. He cannot, however, grant additional honours."
The Grand Commandant Yang Bing memorialised that he be summonsed with a cage cart, and Hou Can committed suicide on the way.
"In former times Emperor Xiaoxuan assembled Confucianists at the Stone Canal Pavilion, and Emperor Zhang gathered scholars in the White Tiger Hall. They made a comprehensive analysis to explain the meaning of the classics. These were great and excellent affairs, representing the true Way of action for both [the sage kings] Wen and Wu [of Zhou], and they should be followed.
In the summer, in the fourth month on the day bingchen [11 May], there was an earthquake.
Before this, when Zhang Huan and Duan Jiong were dealing with the Qiang, they had been in disagreement. Now that Duan Jiong was Director of Retainers, he planned to injure Zhang Huan by having him expelled, sent back to Dunhuang, and held there.Zhang Huan,however, sent Duan Jiong a piteous letter of request, and Duan Jiong let the matter rest.
"In earlier times," said Xun Yu, "Gaozu took the land within the passes, and Emperor Guangwu occupied Henei. Both set their control of the empire on deep roots and a secure base. When they advanced they could defeat their enemies, and if they were forced to retreat they could still maintain their ground. They were sometimes defeated, but in the end they achieved the great work and conquered the empire.
In the summer, in the fourth month on the day wuchen [?]the Grand Commandant Zhou Jing died. The Excellency of Works Xuan Feng left office and the Commandant of the Guards of the Palace of Prolonged Joy, Wang Chang, became Excellency of Works.
Xu Chu of Pei state was braver and stronger than other men. Hecollected several thousand young people and members of his clan,and made firm defences and strong walls to keep out bandits.
In the summer, in the fourth month on the day bingzi [miswritten for bingwu, 3 May], first of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.
Not content with this accumulation of high salary and important position, moreover, they also enrich their private households, storing up masses of goods and treasure, embellishing and furbishing their mansions and estates. They take over whole villages and city districts, they steal from the public water supply in order to develop their own fisheries, and their horses and carriages, costumes and adornments, are comparable to those of the imperial house itself.
And he said to the other Regular Attendants, "From now on we must stay within the palace and not go out to our private estates."
If your majesty looks upon the common people as your children,why do you not extend to them the grace of your soothing and comfort?
The emperor had a great many favourites in the palace, and his concubines numbered five or six thousand, with twice as many handmaids and servants besides. The Empress Deng was a woman of great arrogance and pride, and she quarrelled with the Honoured Lady Guo, whom the emperor had favoured.
When that happens, send your best men to occupy the strategic places and attack them. This way you will win."
I myself lack ability, whether for civil affairs or matters of war, and I am quite unworthy of this high position.Even if I give my life in your service, I cannot make adequate recompense [for this honour and trust].
Dong Zhuo captured some soldiers from the east of the mountains. He took lard and daubed it on a dozen rolls of [44] cloth, then bound the cloth to their bodies and set light to them, beginning at the feet and going up.
Yang Bing now sent in a further memorial, "When I examine the ancient regulations, I find that eunuchs were first used simply as messengers, porters and guards for the inner apartments. Now, however, they receive excessive favour and hold real power.
Even when some of his men planned to revolt,each time it was discovered he wept for the plotters, pardoned themquickly and asked no more about it. So he came to misfortune.
Dong Zhuo appointed his younger brother Min General of the Left, while Dong Huang, son of his elder brother, was Colonel of the Centre Army. Both had control of military affairs.All the members of the Dong clan or relations by marriage held rank at court.
Liu Biao had appointed Liu Wangzhi of Nanyang as an Assistant Officer. Two of his friends, however, were executed by Liu Biao on account of false accusations. Since he himself had made honest criticisms which were not well-received, Liu Wangzhi sent in a petition asking to go home.
Cen Zhi and Zhang Mu got away and fled into hiding.
We should be thinking of the qualities that the Guanju Ode requires, and we must avoid the dangers named in the Five Prohibitions.
He said to the messengers, "I regret that I cannot match the performances of Yi Yin of Shang nor Lu Shang of Zhou; it seems my lot resembles the three virtuous men of Yin.
Then he sent couriers to return the seals and ribbon of the General of the Left and Marquis of Yicheng Village which he had been granted [by the imperial government under Cao Cao].
So Sun Quan summoned Lu Xun and appointed him as Lieutenant-General and Controller of the Division of the Right, replacing Lü Meng.
You need only act quickly,and display the thunder of your power. Use your own judgment to make the decision, and both heaven and man will approve.
Xu Shu went to call upon Liu Bei at Xinye, and Liu Bei held him in high regard.
The borders were peaceful and the people spread across the cultivated land.Liang Xi encouraged farming and gave advice on mulberry-growing. Whatever he ordered was done and whatever he forbade was stopped.
Fan Xian wanted to kill Du Ji in order to intimidate the people,but for the time being he waited to see what he would do. Hebeheaded the Registrar and some thirty other officers [of thecommandery] outside his gate, but Du Ji showed no sign of anxiety.
The Minister of the Household Chen Fan sent in a written remonstrance: "Even in times of peace and security, it is appropriate to maintain restraint in travelling and the chase. How much more strongly should this apply in times such as the present, when wesuffer from the three forms of emptiness.
He went to Tian Chou's lodging and stayed all night to persuade him, but Tian Chou realised the purpose of his discussion and refused to talk.
The [office of the] Imperial Clerks saw the way he felt, so they sent in a false report that Zhang Jun had studied the teachings of the Yellow Turbans. Zhang Jun was arrested and flogged. He died in prison.
So Wang Cheng took Li Xie away to the east, down the Yangzi into Xu province.Li Xie changed his name and became a servant in a wine shop, while Wang Cheng told fortunes in the market-place.Each pretended to be a stranger to the other, and they would visit only in secret.
Now they have all come together, and although they have a con siderable force, none will take orders from another. So their armyhas no accepted leader and they can be destroyed with a singleblow. This makes the job easier, so naturally I am pleased."
Taishi Ci went forward nonetheless, and he came face to face with Sun Ce.Sun Ce wounded Taishi Ci's horse, and grasped the dagger above Taishi Ci's neck. Taishi Ci got Sun Ce's helmet.
When Yuan Shao heard Cao Cao had attacked Chunyu Qiong, hesaid to his son Yuan Tan, "As Cao Cao is defeating Chunyu Qiong,I shall take his camp and he will have nothing to return to."
Fully confident of their position, therefore, the eunuchs built great houses for themselves, rivalling the imperial palace.
In the second month on the day renwu [4 Mar] there was an amnesty for the empire.
Yanxi 延熹 9: 166 AD
"There are already five or six parks outside the city,11 quite enough to make anyone content, and adequate for all the four seasons.
I cannot compare with him, replied Han Fu.
Pang Ji and Shen Pei had always been on bad terms with YuanTan, but Xin Ping and Guo Tu both supported him, so they had afeud with Shen Pei and Pang Ji.
At this time in Luoyang the mansions of the nobility and the imperial relatives stood one beside the other, every house filled with treasure of gold and silk. Dong Zhuo let his soldiers loose to break into these buildings, to plunder the property and to force into marriage the wives and daughters of their families, regardless and unsparing of high position or connection to the throne. T
He ordered the Palace Internuncios to guard the Southern Palace, barring the gates and closing the Covered Way.
Some time later Cao Cao had Shen Pei brought before him, andsaid, "When I was riding earlier you fired several shots at me!"
Liu Yan shifted his administration to Mianzhu, settled the unrest, and was careful to act generously and to obtain the support of the people.
The Lady Xuan, wife of the Gentleman of the Palace Deng Xiang,who was a cousin of the Fortunate Empress [Deng] of Emperor He,had a daughter named Meng.20 Deng Xiang died, and Xuan remarried,this time to Liang Gi,21 who was the maternal uncle of [Liang Ji's wife]Sun Shou.
You should avoid all contact with people in general, have no erratic comings and goings, and be very careful not to say one word about the Liang clan.
Yuan Tan the Inspector of Qing province attacked Kong Rong,and they fought from the spring to the summer. Only a fewhundred fighting men remained to him, and arrows filled the air, butKong Rong reclined on an armrest to study, and he talked andlaughed unconcerned.
Du Kui, however, observed, "You do not have the title Sonof Heaven. To assemble such an orchestra and have it play in court,is that proper behaviour?" Liu Biao abandoned the idea.
Cao Cao appointed him Counsellor[241] Remonstrant and Adviser to the Army of the Excellency ofWorks.
Believing their men were too few to match the enemy, the officers were very doubtful about this plan.
As He Jin considered his plans for several more days, inform- ation leaked out, and the eunuchs became frightened and thought of rebellion.
In the third month the Court Architect Kong Rong was sent with theStaff of Authority to appoint Yuan Shao as General-in-Chief, withgovernment over the four provinces Ji, Qing, You and Bing.
Sun Quan was besieging Hefei. His forces had surrounded the cityfor a long time, but it did not fall.
There was drought at this time, the harvest was spoilt, and thegentry and the people were cold and hungry. So Yuan Shu's powersteadily declined.
But then Tao Qian began to put his trust in slanderers and evil men, granting them office and keeping loyal and upright men at a distance. As law and government were poorly administered, the province declined into disorder.
Lü Meng replied, "Lu Xun thinks deep and far, and he could bear heavy responsibility. I have seen how he plans things: he will be able to hold great office. But he is not yet well known, so Guan Yu will pay him small concern. He would be quite the best choice.
The General of the Guards Dong Cheng was made General ofChariots and Cavalry.
In the summer, in the fourth month on the day jiayin [17 May] there was a fire in the temple apartments of the funerary park of Anling [the tomb of Emperor Hui of Former Han].
Dong Zhuo was at Luoyang. Yuan Shao and the other armies were all afraid of his strength and none dared go forward.
Drawing his sword, he turned on Song Zhong, "If I cut your head off now, it would not make me feel any better, and since we shall not see one another again, a man of honour would be ashamed to kill a fellow like you."
Yet Du Mu says, "When Xun Yu encouraged Wu of Wei tohold Yan province, he compared him to Gaozu and Guangwu;when Cao Cao was at Guandu and he urged him not to withdraw toXu city, he made comparison with Chu and Han.
The people of their country made up a song about them: A model for the empire, Fang Bowu; Grasping appointment from his teaching, Zhou Zhongjin.
At this Yuan Shao's army was alarmed and upset and fell into utterconfusion.
I wish to go privately, and with luck I may get through."
With one blow you cut off an arm of the Yuanclan and free a whole district from peril. Lord Cao will surely begrateful, and nothing could rival your fine reputation."
Then Lü Bu said to Ji Ling and his party, "Xuande [Liu Bei]51is my younger brother. He is in trouble with you, and I have come tohelp him.
Then Yan Zhong took ill and died, and Han Sui and the others struggled for power and began to kill one another. So they were gradually weakened.
Besides, Guo Duo has taken the senior ministers and holds them hostage. He acts like this and you still want to help him?"
Yet the reason the state continued and did not collapse into destruction was that on the one hand there were excellencies,ministers and high officials such as Yuan An, Yang Zhen, Li Gu, Du Qiao, Chen Fan and Li Ying, who debated in the imperial presence and struggled to support the state with justice and honour in its time of danger.And at the same time there were scholars of plain clothing such as Fu Rong, Guo Tai, Fan Pang and Xu Shao, who held private discussions to help in that time of chaos.
Tang Xuan, elder brother of Tang Heng, who was Intendant of Jingzhao, had an old quarrel with Zhao Qi.He arrested the family and dependents of Zhao Qi and several more distant members of his clan, charged them with the utmost severity of the law, and killed every one of them.
Then the sun went down, and Cao Cao was able to make his retreat.
The bandit Dong Zhuo has taken advantage of a temporary confusion and compelled the officials to obey him, so this is a moment of difficulty for the house of Han.
The men of Faction lived in an age of confusion and disorder, when all things were out of place and the four seas were in turmoil. They sought to solve problems by the words of their mouths, giving judgements of good and bad as a means to wipe out evil and restore purity. They sought to seize snakes and vipers by the head, and trample the tails of tigers and wolves. But it was they who were injured and wrongfully punished, and the misfortune reached their friends. Men of quality were destroyed, and the nation went on to disaster. The pity of it!
Bu Yang and Pan Hong, however, still had a strong following, and Du Shang wanted to continue the attack. His officers and men, however, satisfied with their achievements and concerned with their newly-acquired wealth, had no wish to fight further.
He agreed to accept just one large coin from each of them.
And this is like men sailing in the same boat: if one thing goes wrong we shall all of us drown.
Recognising the truth of this, Cao Cao strengthened hisdefences and held on.
"If Yuan Shu defeats Liu Bei, then he willjoin with all the leaders of Mount Tai in the north and I shall besurrounded. I must help Liu Bei."
In the spring, in the first month on the day jimao [16 Feb], there was an amnesty for the empire.
In the autumn, in the seventh month on the day jiwei [6 Aug] there was a fire at the Door of Continuing Excellence in the Southern Palace.
Before this, the Master of Writing Zhou Bi of Wuwei and the Colonel of the City Gates Wu Qiong of Runan had suggested to Dong Zhuo that he should reform the government of Emperors Huan and Ling and appoint famous scholars to office. By this means he would gain the hearts of the people.Dong Zhuo followed this advice. He commissioned Zhou Bi and Wu Qiong, with the Master of Writing Zheng Tai and the Chief Clerk He Rong, to sift out dishonest and wicked men and bring forward those who had been unjustly neglected in the past.
and if I can stay in the commandery for just onemonth it will give me time to arrange a plan to keep them quiet."
At my age of eighty years, I wish to remove this danger from you. I recommend that you take the occasion of the eclipse as a reason to dismiss the eunuchs, in order to avert the omen from Heaven."
Xun You said, "Our men are too few to match the enemy.In order to win, you must divide our opponents' strength.
"In setting up teaching or establishing a custom, it is alwaysbest to keep to the middle path, for that is easiest to follow.
On theother hand, while fine scholars such as Zuo Chengzu and Liu Yixunwere invited to sit with him, that was all, for he would never discussmatters of government with them. He said nonetheless, "These arefamous men and people look up to them. I must not lose them."
We beg to finish this business, then go to the Minister of Justice for punishment."
Because of this, Gongsun Du was pleased at his worth and the people were influenced by his virtue.
Hejian, however, is our own territory, and though it is good toannounce the defeat of Tian Yin and his fellow rebels, I amashamed there should ever have been need for such a campaign."
Chen Gong said to Lü Bu, "Attack them at once. With fresh soldiersto deal with tired ones you cannot fail."
"Lord of Longshu" refers to Fan Pang's father, Fan Xian, who had been Chancellor of the marquisate of Longshu.
Considering that he had now held one high post after another, Huangfu Gui wanted very much to retire. He sent in several reports pleading ill health, but his requests were not granted.
Dong Zhuo recommended that the Intendant of Henan, Zhu Jun, become Minister Coachman and act as his Assistant. A messenger brought the summons to office, but Zhu Jun excused himself and would not accept. Then he said, "If the emperor moves west, he will surely destroy the hopes of the empire, because he will be confirming the rift with the east of the mountains. I see no advantage in it."
The Gentleman of the Palace Zhang Jun of Zhongshan sent in a memorial, "It is my humble opinion that the reasons Zhang Jue was able to raise troops and make his rebellion, and that the people love him and trust him, are because your ten Regular Attendants have sent family members, relatives and dependents to take control of the provinces."They steal the wealth of the people by cruel taxation and they plunder and rob the poor. The people have no way to tell their grievances, and so they make plans for rebellion and gather together as bandits.
In the time of Duke Huan of Qi, though the house of Zhou wasweak, the situation was not so bad as that Han at the beginning ofthe Jian'an period.
The Master of Writing Zhu Mu objected to the eunuchs' abuse of power,and he sent in a letter, saying: "I note that in the old system of Han some Regular Attendants were chosen from full gentlemen. It is only since the Jianwuperiod [25-55 AD, in the time of the founding Emperor Guangwu of Later Han], that all these positions have been given to eunuchs.
So Cao Cao sent Cao Hong, General of the Household WhoManifests Firmness, to lead troops [195] west and receive the Sonof Heaven. Dong Cheng and the others, however, held the passesagainst him, and Cao Hong could not get through.
"while the government and virtue of theGeneral Who Exterminates Rebels [Sun Ce] have already attractedthe people. The General Who Exterminates Caitiffs [Sun Quan] canbuild on these foundations, so that great and small follow hiscommands. Zhang Zhao can look after affairs of government, whileothers like me act as claws and teeth. With strategic advantage andsupport from the people, there is surely no cause for concern."
Yuan Shu fled into Jiujiang.
In the past, Zhu Han had been treated rudely by Han Fu, and he now sought to anticipate Yuan Shao's intentions. Without authority he brought troops to surround Han Fu's house and went in carrying a sword. Han Fu fled to the upper storey, but Zhu Han seized his eldest son, beat him and broke both his legs.
"Feng Gun previously defeated the barbarians of Jing province, and his merit is comparable to that of [Yin] Jifu.
The magistrate of Kaocheng, Wang Huan of Henei, appointed Qiu Xiang as his Registrar, and said to him, "I have heard that when you were at Pu village, you, did not punish Chen Yuan but reformed. You seem to have been reluctant to act as an eagle or a hawk."
Following Chen Gui's advice, Lü Bu wrote to Han Xian andYang Feng, "You two gentlemen rescued the emperor, and I killedDong Zhuo with my own hand. Each of us made his reputation[through these achievements]. Why do you join rebellion with YuanShu? Far better if we unite our forces, defeat Yuan Shu, and removeharm from the state."
Liu Bei said to Liu Dai and his fellows, "I can deal with you and ahundred like you, but if Lord Cao came himself I would feel lesscertain."
Zhang Huan was formerly on good terms with the Su family, but Duan Jiong had been a close friend of Li Gao. Duan Jiong appointed Su Buwei [to his own staff] as Assistant Officer to the Director of Retainers, but Su Buwei was afraid; he claimed to be ill and would not go.
but Zhou Yu said, "I have command of the army and cannot leave my post. If your master will be gracious enough to call upon me, that is just what I expect!"
Du Ji knewthat the counties would remain loyal to him, so he went out of thecity with a few score horsemen, occupied a strong fort, and set uphis defences. Many of the officials and people held their cities onDu Ji's behalf, and within a few weeks he had gathered more thanfour thousand men.
Chen Fan sent a letter to criticise them, "The principles of the past require that duty be maintained even when the ruler dies.

From Jiaozhi, Liu Ba went to SHU to join Liu Zhang.

Some time later, Cao Zhi the Marquis of Linzi rode a carriage fast down the centre of the imperial highway, and he had a Major's Gate opened to let him through.
"When I first received appointment, I believed we could do great things together to aid the imperial house.
But how can one speak of the attitude of a parent if these people are regarded merely as animals or as grass and brambles; if no thought is taken as to whether or not they are behaving well, if no distinction is made between them, and if they are simply mown down or slaughtered indiscriminately?
On the day guisi [8 Aug] rewards were given for the selection of the emperor. Dou Wu was enfeoffed as Marquis of Wenxi and his son Dou Ji became Marquis of Weiyang. Dou Wu's nephews, Dou Shao and Dou Jing, were made marquises of Hu and of Xi District respectively.The Regular Attendant Cao Jie became Marquis of Chang'an District. Altogether eleven men received fiefs.
"Many people at this time follow the words of prophecies and try to match affairs to the texts of unorthodox books. Thinking only of pleasing their master, they pay no attention to reality.
If I accepted this humiliating way of escape, I should always suffer the shame of the accusation. Alive, I shall appear as a bad official; dead, I will be a miserable ghost.
The soldiers east of the mountains are in rebellion. We cannot put them down immediately, so we shift the capital to deal with them properly. This is just like the time of Qin and early Han."
The emperor recalled how the Dowager Dou had brought him to the throne and, as recognition of this, in the winter in the tenth month on the day wuzi [16 Nov], first of the month, he brought all the officials to pay their respects to the Dowager in the Southern Palace.

Li Jue sent Fan Chou, Guo Si and his elder brother's son Li Li to attack Ma Teng. Ma Teng was defeated and fled, and went back to Liang province.

The Consultant Dong Zhao noted that Yang Feng had a strongforce of foot-soldiers and horsemen, but few supporters at court. Hewrote to him on Cao Cao's behalf, saying, "Knowing yourreputation and admiring your fine deeds, I offer my full and sincerefriendship. You have saved the emperor from his difficulties andhave returned his court to the old capital. No-one else can matchyour achievement in his support. How splendid!
Now in the frontier regions of the western provinces the soil is poor and barren, and the people turn more and more to banditry and plunder. Houses and farms are in ruins, and though there may still be people living there, they are really no more than dead bones.
The Protector of the Army Pang Ji had long been an enemy ofShen Pei. Yuan Shao asked him about the matter, and he [292]replied, "Shen Pei is fiercely honest and always respects theexamples of the ancients. He could not turn traitor just because histwo sons are in the south.
Cao Cao came forward to Ye and made hills and tunnelsto attack it.
I now intend to transferpeople from south of the Huai. What do you think?" "At that time," replied Jiang Ji, "your troops were weak and theenemy was strong: had you not shifted the people you wouldcertainly have lost them.
Dong Zhuo's sons, even those still in the arms of maidservants and concubines, were enfeoffed as marquises and played with gold seals and purple ribbons.

"If people will not come to you," replied Kuai Liang, "it is because you have not shown sufficient humanity. If they come, but then act badly, it is because you have not shown sufficient justice.
The first thing to do is to give strict orders to the Inspectors and the heads of commanderies and kingdoms that they must stop people wandering about and send them back to their own territory. This way we shall isolate his party and can then punish the ringleaders. Everything would be settled without trouble."

The enemy commanders will be convinced that any substantial force must come [directly east] from Wuzhong, and if it cannot get forward it will have to withdraw. They will be idle and will make no preparations.
These Qiang and the other non-Chinese have evil hearts and the nature of dogs. I have not been able to bring them to order, but I shall stay to keep them quiet.
The Excellency over the Masses Yang Ci protested, "The system of the former emperors waIn this year there were constructed the Jade Sceptre Park for Bird Netting and the Park of Spiritual Jade.that on the left they opened up the Vast Pond and on the right they constructed the Shanglin Park. They were neither extravagant nor parsimonious, and so they achieved the proper balance required by ceremony.
Any administrator or magistrate with something to hide abandoned his seal and ribbon and fled away as soon as he heard Fan Pang was coming.In every memorial and report that he sent in, Fan Pang gave full expression to the opinions of the people.
Now the beginnings of good fortune certainly depend upon a man being lucky, but their fulfilment in prosperity requires that he shall then prove to be of excellent character. If virtue is present, then we have the beginnings[of good fortune]; but if virtue is not present, those are signs of disaster.
Liu Bei appointed Zhuge Liang as General of the Household Master of the Army, and sent him to take charge of the threecommanderies Lingling, Guiyang and Changsha, and to levy sufficient taxes for the needs of the army. Lieutenant-General Zhao Yun held command as Administrator of Guiyang.
"Those wicked servants have many eyes and ears," replied Liu He. "I fear we would suffer misfortune before we could bring our own arrangements together."
Huang Gai, a divisional commander under Zhou Yu, said, "The enemy are many and we are few. It will be difficult to hold them for long.
Guo Si was killed by his ownfollower Wu Xi.
The Regular Attendants Su Kang and Guan Ba had enclosed good farmland and fine properties throughout the empire, while the provincial and commandery authorities had not dared to make any objection. [Though it was not strictly within his area of responsibility,] the Minister of Finance Liu You sent in a letter on the matter, suggesting their lands and properties should be confiscated in accordance with their nature and the circumstances.
The Southern Shanyu Yufuluo died. His younger brother Huchu-quan took his place and set his residence at Pingyang.
Now think about Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He. They are no match for our officers.
Guo Jia then said, "Yuan Shao will go north to attack GongsunZan. You can take advantage of his absence and go east to deal withLü Bu.
So Tao Qian sent Zhao Yu to take a memorial to Chang'an.
He should be sober and anxious, but instead he rejoices. How can this last long?
Cheng Huang then issued an anonymous circular saying that, "Cai Yong and Cai Zhi have on several occasions sought favour for their private interests from Liu He, but Liu He refused their importunities.
He presented Liu Xun with pearls and jewels and Yue cloth.
Later, Cao Cao seized Liu Zong's power and boasted how he would lead hundreds of thousands of sailors and soldiers together down the river. When I asked my officers for advice, not one of them had anything to suggest, while Zhang Zibu [Zhang Zhao] and Qin Wenbiao [Qin Song] both said that we should send tribute and receive Cao Cao.
Shi Bi of Chenliu, Adjutant of the Northern Army, sent in a sealed letter, "I have heard that the proper attitude of an emperor or king towards his relatives and kinsmen is that although his affection is abundant he will certainly display it with authority, and even though the person is of noble birth he will certainly apply the regular restraints to him.
If you think back to the days of the Western Capital [under Former Han], it was through false ministers seizing power that the empire was brought to ruin.
If I slander him in return, and confuse your sage hearing, that would be no advantage to anyone."
As soon as Guan Yu heard that Nan commandery had fallen, he returned in haste to the south.
In the summer, in the fifth month on the day jiaxu [13 Jul], last of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.
Gongsun Zan went back into You province and dared not come out again.
Before this, the Commandant of the Capital Cui Yan had recom mended Yang Xun of Julu to Cao Cao, who treated him courteously and gave him office.
Wang Yun said, "If I have received blessing from the national altars, then my only wish would be to give peace to our country. If this cannot be achieved, then I offer myself to die for it.
Wait threeyears, until the people are following their occupations in peace; thenyou can apply the regular laws."
Cai Yong is resentful and seeks harm Liu He."
The Imperial Secretariat criticised him for attacking so many, and suggested he was making his accusations out of personal malice.
Sun Jian's advance division replied, "We have long suffered the toil of fighting and labour, and we come to ask you for supplies."
Chen Fan and Dou Wu were annoyed at this.There came an occasion they met together at the court, and Chen Fan said privately to Dou Wu, "Cao Jie, Wang Fu and the rest of them have held power since the time of the late emperor, and they have confused and disturbed all the empire. Unless we execute them now, they will certainly upset things for us later."
"I cannot run away and abandon my ministers!" replied the emperor. "That would be a poor return for their service."
In the autumn, in the seventh month, Duan Jiong sent a thousand men to Xi county to construct a barrier of trees against them, twenty feet across and forty li long.
She went out to greethim, bowed once, then called, "Gentlemen, show yourselves!" SunGao and Fu Ying came out together and killed Gui Lan, and theother men went and killed Dai Yuan
That night the convoy came to Baling. The attendants were hungry, and Zhang Ji allocated rations to each person.
It is inappropriate that I should even hear of such a plan."
Those who had been criticised by Cai Yong thought now only of revenge.
Within the city all supplies were gone, and there was no hope of relief from the outside.Knowing he could not escape, Zang Hong said to his military and civil officers, soldiers and people, "Yuan is a man without principle, and his ambitions are disloyal. Moreover, he gave no help to the leader of my commandery. For my own honour, I must die.
The Administrator of Kuaiji, Chunyu Shi, sent in a memorialsaying, "Lu Xun oppresses and kidnaps the people. There is misery and trouble wherever he goes."
Zhu Jun has already gained considerable success in Yingchuan, and now he is leading his army against the south and his plans are settled. All military writers caution against changing generals in the middle of a campaign. We may wait for days or even months, but he will eventually produce results."
Ju Shou objected, "You haveonly just dealt with Gongsun Zan, and your army has been awayseveral years. The people are sick and distressed and the granariesand storehouses are empty.
Sun Quan attacked two camps of hills bandits at Mo and Bao and pacified them.
but Jiao Chu said,"Great affairs must be founded on justice, and a single man willmake no difference to whether we succeed or fail. Let him hold tohis principles, for he is an example of loyal service to us all."
Yuan Shao again urged He Jin, "In the past, when Dou Wu planned to kill the palace favourites, the only reason he came to grief was because he allowed the news to leak out. "The men of the five regiments [of the Northern Army] feared the eunuchs and were prepared to obey them, but Dou Wu had counted on those troops, so he brought misfortune upon himself.
Emperor Guangwu encountered a time of decline in the middle of Han, with bold men bubbling up like boiling gruel. He rose from amongst the common people, but he restored the greatness of the past. He waged war in every direction, and he had no free time on any day, but he still appreciated the learning of the classics. He invited scholars as his guests, he opened schools everywhere, he revived the Rites and Music and made them clear.
Yang Biao said, "Imperial subjects are fighting one another, one man has kidnapped the Son of Heaven while another holds the highest officials hostage. What sort of situation is this?"
The governors of provinces and administrators of commanderies all follow the way the wind is blowing, and in their selection of candidates for office they reject the worthy men and put forward fools. It is for this reason that locusts appear, and that there is so much trouble from barbarians and bandits. Heaven has been angry about this for more than ten years now, so year after year there have been eclipses above and earthquakes below, in attempts to reprimand the ruler and bring him to his senses, that he may weed out those [of his ministers and attendants] who are unsuitable.
Chen Yu took fright and retreated to Xiapi. Then Yuan Shu took over his territory and claimed the additional title "Lord of Xu province."
Should I be arrogant enough to accept this fief,then even if I went there with my face hidden, it would still cause august Heaven to shake with anger, and disasters would flow down upon the people.Where could I seek refuge from that?"
Zhang Rang made false accusation against him, saying that he was a supporter of Zhang Jue and planned to act as traitor within the gates. He was arrested and sent to the Northern Prison of the Yellow Gates, and was killed there.
Yin Xun and Shan Bing now recommended the arrest of Cao Jie and others, and Liu Yu was sent to take the memorial into the palace.
In that case, once he had defeated you he would hurry on toXu city with light-armed troops, leaving his officers to hold the rear.
Realising that he was cut off, Guan Yu went west to hold Maicheng.
In the summer, in the fifth month Cao Cao withdrew all his forces from Hanzhong and returned to Chang'an. So Liu Bei held Hanzhong.
Fa Zheng sent a written message to Liu Zhang. He set out the situation, then went on to say, "Since the General of the Left [Liu Bei] raised troops he has always thought well of you. He is truly not a man of mean nature.
here is, however, a code of conduct establishedfor rulers and their ministers: just as we share in success or failure,so in all important matters we should take counsel together."
When Guan Ning was young he was a friend of Hua Xin. On one occasion he was hoeing a vegetable plot with him when they saw gold in the ground. Guan Ning continued hoeing and did not turn to look at it, as if it was nothing but a tile or a stone. Hua Xin took it up, then threw it away. From this people recognised their different qualities.
Then Jia Cong issued a proclamation to say that everyone should carry on his occupation in peace, and he received and comforted the homeless refugees and remitted the taxes and corvee levies. Only [184] the most troublesome ringleaders were executed, and he then made careful selection of the best men to show their ability as heads of counties. The disturbance was settled within a year, and all the people were at peace.
West from the Qiao Gate and east from Luochuan there are old frontier stations, cities and towns,so communications are easy to maintain. This is not country which is deeply divided or dangerous. Carriages and horsemen can travel without difficulty or interruption.
It is not appropriate that you extend your gracious leniency to a person such as this. I ask that he be dismissed from office and sent back to his home commandery".
On another occasion, when Jia Biao was magistrate of Xinxi, the poor people of the county were in desperate distress, and many abandoned their infants.
You should permit the return of his family and dependents, and you should release the bonds of proscription.Now the chief ministers are extremely important, and the fortunes of the state depend upon them. Among the four excellencies at the present time, only the Excellency of Works Liu Chong is completely honest and worthy.All the rest of them are false, men who encourage rebellion and who draw their stipend without working for it. Inevitably,they 'break the tripod of the cauldron and overturn the gruel'.They should be dismissed on account of the ill omens. If you summon the former Excellency of Works Wang Chang, and the Steward of the Palace of Prolonged Joy Li Ying, they are both worthy to guide the affairs of state, and this medley of disasters and dangers will cease. The prosperity of the state may be established for a long time to come.
Jian'an 2: 197 AD
Guo Tai understood all types of men, he enjoyed praising or admonishing them, and he would travel about the commanderies and kingdoms.
Six of the provinces had great floods, and the sea at Bohai flooded inland.
Back in camp, however, Huang Zu treated Gan Ning no better than before.
In just the same way as one vessel should not contain charcoal and ice, so wicked men and virtuous men should not take part in government together.
Nonetheless Han Fu and Yuan Shao sent Zhang Qi, former Administrator of Lelang, with a deputation to offer Liu Yu the imperial title.
He [417] divided Yuzhang to create Poyang commandery, andChangsha to form Hanchang commandery. Cheng Pu returned asAdministrator of Jiangxia, while Lu Su became Administrator ofHanchang and camped at Lukou.
It was the gentle government of the Ancient Duke and the Lord of the West that attracted all the empire;would they have needed to send carts laden with gold, and carriages of treasure, as a favour to the people?
Dong Zhuo made himself Grand Commandant controlling the affairs of the General of the Van. He also took the Staff and Insignia, Battle-Axe, Ceremonial Axe and Gentlemen Rapid as Tigers, and changed his fief to become Marquis of Mei.
In the eleventh month Dong Zhuo was made Chancellor of State, with the right to perform obeisance without calling his own name, to enter court without hastening step, and to stand in the hall of audience with sword and shoes.
and also make my aged mother a fugitive?"
while The Art of War forbids it, saying this will surely bring the greatest general to his downfall.
Speaking at the wrong time brings misfortune."
Then the Lady Xu changed back into her mourning clothes andoffered the heads of Gui Lan and Dai Yuan as sacrifice to the tombof Sun Yi. All the army was shaken and afraid.
"A loyal minister, it might seem, would kill himself to appease his master's anger, and a filial son would give his life to soothe his father's rage. So the great Shun refused to avoid the dangers of the earthen granary or the deep-dug well, and Shensheng made no arguments against the wicked slanders of his father's wife.
In the eighth month on the day wuchen [28 Sep] it was ordered for the first time that those people in the commanderies and kingdoms who owned farmland should pay a tax in cash on each mu at the time of the harvest.
In the intercalary [third] month on the day jiawu [jiazi?: 11 May] [Liu Shu] the grandfather of the emperor was posthumously honoured as Xiaoyuan Emperor, and his wife of the Xia family became the Xiaoyuan Empress. The emperor's late father [Liu Chang] was named Xiaoren Emperor, and the emperor's mother of the Dong family became Honoured Lady of the Funerary Park of Circumspection.
Chong Ji asked persistently, even up to midnight, but the emperor still refused.
Then Liu Bei seized those three commanderies, Liu Ba's work was undone, and he planned to go back to the capital district by way of Jiao province.
and those that crossed with him were the Empress, and Yang Biao, and a few dozen others. All the palace women, officials and people that could not get across were robbed by the soldiers: their clothing was taken and even their hair was cut off. More people died from the cold than could be counted.
"Liu Zhang, however, was dull and weak, and since the time of Liu Yan one generation after another has shown generosity. Seeking to curry favour with their subjects, they limited the effect of the law. As a result, the virtue of government has not been displayed, and the majestic punishments fail to command respect.
You, wise general, may rest on a high pillow with your doors open [in security and confidence]. Why should you be concerned or frightened?"
Yuan Shu attacked Liu Bei to fight for Xu province.
Scholars of loyalty and generosity, of purity and cultivation, not only were they respected by the ministers and gentry, they were appreciated by even the common people.
The magistrate of Jufeng [in Jiuzhen commandery] was greedy and oppressive and acted without restraint,Zhu Da and other men of the county joined forces with the local barbarians to make rebellion, and they attacked the magistrate and killed him.They gathered as many as four or five thousand men.
When the late Emperor was angry with the Dowager and she was on the brink of destruction, it was we who wept and managed to save her, and each of us gave thousands and tens of thousands from our private fortunes to make the emperor contented again.49 All we sought was the patronage of your house.
If Liu Bei cannot match Lord Cao, even if you held all of Chu you would not be able to maintain your position; and if Liu Bei is indeed a match for Lord Cao, he will never agree to serve you."
In the fifth month the Grand Commandant Deng Sheng left office. The Minister Coachman Zhang Yan of Henan was made Grand Commandant.
At the same time, if he should be here, it is my judgement that he is a celebrated scholar; is it really necessary for your honour to arrest him?"
Guo Jia argued, "Your authority makes the empire tremble, butthe northern barbarians are relying upon the fact that they are a long way away. They will certainly not be prepared for you. If we take advantage of their miscalculation and attack them quickly, they can be defeated and destroyed.
In the second month Yuan Shang made another attack on Yuan Tanat Pingyuan, leaving his officers Shen Pei and Su You to hold Ye.
Abandoning his wife and children, Liu Bei fled with Zhuge Liang, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and a few score horsemen. Cao Cao captured all his army and his baggage.
Jiao Chu proclaimed himself Inspector of You province, andpersuaded the civil officials in all the commanderies to abandon theYuan and transfer their allegiance to Cao Cao.
Liu Zhang then returned to Chengdu and Liu Bei went north toJiameng. Before he departed for the campaign against Zhang Lu,however, he acted with generosity and grace to win the hearts of thepeople.
This is why Yu-Shun first banished the four criminals before he appointed the sixteen chancellors. He well understood that if evil-doers were not driven away good men would never come forward.
That night Zhou Yu spoke again with Sun Quan, and said,"Whenthose men saw Cao Cao's letter about eight hundred thousand soldiers and sailors, they were all afraid, and the advice they offered was given without any thought whether the figures were true or he was simply boasting. It was quite pointless.
He pays small attention to superficial matters, but his government keeps the people at peace. I beg your lordship to think again."
"As their men-at-arms suffer defeat outside, and their ministersof counsel are killed within,16 the brothers slander and quarrel withone another. Their state is divided in two, and they have been in thissituation for a whole year. Their soldiers' clothes have lice, there isdrought, there are locusts, and there is famine everywhere. Suchdisasters from Heaven above reflect the chaos afflicting the affairsof men below. Anyone can see that they are done for. Now is thetime Heaven has abandoned Yuan Shang.
In the course of that year He Luan killed Yan Jun and was in turn destroyed by Wang Bi of Wuwei.
An imperial edict ordered the Director of Retainers Liu Meng to search out and arrest those responsible, and to report results every ten days.
In the autumn in the seventh month the Excellency of Works Liu Ao left office. In the eighth month the Minister Herald Qiao Xuan from Liang kingdom became Excellency of Works.
I have heard of people fanning a fire to stop soup from boiling, but it is much better to take away the firewood.Though it is painful to burst an abscess, it is better than a malignant tumour.
None of them, however, are any use in dealing with military matters, and now they have taken up arms against you they are simply not in your class.
but this was his only weakness, and not enough to discount his two fine actions.
"Cruel and slanderous officials have spread broad nets for me, and they encourage one another against us. It is as if they pursued an enemy.
Liu Kuan, Chancellor of Donghai, was appointed Director of the Imperial Secretariat.
In the third month, Cao Cao led his troops away, but he left the General Who Calms the Waves Xiahou Dun as Area Commander over Cao Ren, Zhang Liao and others, and theycamped at Juchao with twenty-six armies.
"Gongtai,' said Cao Cao to Chen Gong, "you always claimed toknow more than others, and now you end like this!"
Po Qin readily agreed, "I respectfully request your guidance."Later, when Cao Cao brought the emperor to Xu city, Zhao Yansaid to Po Qin, "The General Who Maintains the East in Peace, CaoCao, can certainly save the empire. I know where I am going."
The [county] marquisates which had been awarded by favour to Shan Chao, Xu Huang and Tang Heng were now reduced to district fiefs, while those of their family who had shared the fiefs were stripped of their titles.
"You were invited to take an appointment and have turned it down," said the messenger. "Nothing was said about shifting the capital, yet you raise the matter. Why is this?"
Cao Cao went to offer sacrifice at the tomb of Yuan Shao, and weptfor him until the tears flowed.
Chen Deng the Administrator of Guangling had his capital at She yang. When Sun Ce went west to attack Huang Zu, Chen Dengencouraged the remnants of White Tiger Yan's following to maketrouble behind him.
So He Jin spoke to the Dowager, asking to dismiss all the Regular Attendants and those of lower rank, and to appoint Gentle- men of the Three Corps to fill their places.
Now if Zhang Huan has been dragging his feet and delayed going forward, that is because he is concerned that though [the barbarians] may appear to be divided, they are in fact united.If that was the case, there would be trouble everywhere as soon as his soldiers made a move.
Yuan Shao made his son Tan Inspector of Qing province. Tian Kai fought him but without success.
In the sixth month the Xianbi raided Liaodong.
Li Xie's sister warned him, "Our family has been almost wiped out, and the ancestral sacrifices discontinued. By great good fortune you have been saved, and this is surely the work of Heaven.
As Cen Zhi made his escape, all his family and friends joined to help conceal him. Only Jia Biao closed his door and refused to take him in. Some were angry with him,
"When Yue Yang ate [306] his child, "replied Cheng Ji, "it wasnot because he lacked the feelings of a father for his son, butbecause there were greater principles at stake which forced him toit.
It is difficult to judge good fortune and ill, replied Song Yi, "but the first principle must be to obey an imperial command."
If you want the people to flourish, with abundant prosperity, then the first requirement is to put a stop to the demands for public labour services and to prohibit private extortion. If you did that, the people would have enough for their needs without any great effort.
"Go away, Kongzhang [Chen Lin]! Seek advantage where you will. I, Zang Hong, devote my life to personal loyalty. You follow the leader of the alliance [Yuan Shao], I serve [the emperor at] Chang'an."You say I shall die and my name will be lost. But I can laugh at you, who must live in ignominy."
Try to get help from the leaders east of the passes. Urge them to think of the nation."
On that very day,however, Guo Tai was at the academy. Zuo Yuan remembered what had been said to him before and felt ashamed of himself. So he gave up his plan and went away.
Chen Shi said, "If I do not go to the jail, people will feel there is no one they can trust in."
Wei Gu and his party wanted to bepopular, so they followed his advice.
Li Jue sent Wang Chang, one of the guards Rapid as Tigers, to call Huangfu Li back, intending to kill him. Recognising that Huangfu Li was loyal and honest, however, Wang Chang let him go and told Li Jue that "We chased him but could not catch him."
They arrived at Anzhong, and the army had enemies front andrear. During the night Cao Cao dug entrenchments in the pass andthen feigned retreat.
The Excellency over the Masses Zhao Wen sent a letter to Li Jue saying, "You began with massacre and looting in the imperial city, and you slaughtered the great ministers. Then you quarrelled over some trivial insult and have made it a battle of life and death.
Yuan Shao was embarrassed and annoyed to be lower in rankthan Cao Cao. He remarked angrily that, "There were severaloccasions Cao Cao was in danger of death, and I was quick to helphim and save him. Now he is making use of the Son of Heaven togive me orders." He sent in a memorial with excuses and refused theappointment.
Once you have destroyed Huang Zu's army, drum the advance to the west and occupy the Passes of Chu.Your power will grow and extend, and you will eventually be able to take over the territory of Ba and Shu.
Zhao Bao wrote in to ask leave to return home for the funeral. The emperor sent messengers of condolence and enfeoffed him as Marquis of Yu.
Fan Pang said, "Gaoyao was a loyal minister in ancient times. If he knows I am innocent, he will explain things properly to the Emperor [of Heaven]. If I should be guilty of something, then what is the point of making a sacrifice?" Because of this, other prisoners also ceased to offer sacrifice.
Then he called out loud, "Chen Fan and Dou Wu have sent in a memorial telling the Dowager to depose the emperor. This is high treason!"
Zuo Guan and Tang Heng were also appointed Regular Attendants.
Sun Ce entered Qu'a and gave rewards to his troops. He made generous proclamation through all the counties [of Wu], "When any fellow-countryman or former supporter of Liu Yao and Zhai Rong comes to surrender, no questions will be asked. Of those who volunteer to join the army, each man who goes will satisfy the tax and labour requirements of his household. Those who do not wish to go will not be forced."
If Chunyu Qiong and the others aretaken then we shall all be captives."
though your prowessshook the ground beneath their feet, this is nonetheless the task of asubaltern, not what the commander should be doing.
When soldiers rose up in the provinces and commanderies, LiuChong led his troops to camp at Yangxia and took title as General in-Chief Who Supports Han.
and Liu Biao was angry. Because Huang Zu,the Administrator of Jiangxia, had a quick temper, he sent Ni Hengto him.
In earlier times, Emperor Gao tolerated the criticisms of Zhou Chang, even when they were sacrilegious,and Emperor Cheng pardoned Zhu Yun, though he was worthy of the neck and waist execution.If you kill Li Yun now, I fear the peopleof the empire may compare you to [Zhou Xin] who cut out the heart [of his minister Bi Gan]."
He who finds his true lord will prosper, but the man who makes a bad choice will die.
Embarrassed, Yuan Shao had Chen Rong led out, remarking, "You are not one of Zang Hong's people. This is pointless."
"Once the matter is settled, you can give him a generous fief,and that will avoid any charge of disloyalty. If you do not take himtoday, he will eventually fall to someone else."
Jin Yun wept and said, "I do not dare to have a double heart [and act unfaithfully]."
"Since the time I suffered accusation, three amnesties have been issued and two opportunities for redemption.50 No evidence [has been presented] to support the charges, and this alone should justify some remission.
Lu Su urged Sun Quan to lend Jing province to Liu Bei so thatthey could deal with Cao Cao together, and Sun Quan agreed.
all with flags of the Yuan army. Gagging themen and tying the horses' mouths, they went out by night andmoved along side-paths between the roads. The men carried boundfirewood. If anyone questioned them, they explained that, "LordYuan is afraid Cao Cao may attack his afterguard, so he is sending reinforcements to the defence."
If our soldiers are worn out from fighting beyond their [262] bordersand the state has been left empty behind them, and if Sun Ce takesthat opportunity to attack, we shall not be able to manage alone.
Zheng Tai resigned his position and went away, observing to Xun You, "It is not easy to assist Lord He!"
The Banshun barbarians raided and plundered Ba commandery. Campaigns had been sent against them year after year, but they had not been subdued.
Du Ji also said to Wei Gu and his fellows, "It is only naturalthat a man should be concerned for his family. Let your officerstake turns to go home on leave. It will not be difficult to call themback when you need them."
As a result, both [259] sides will be angry withyou, and we are afraid that you will not be able to maintain a neutralposition.
Zhu Wenming [Zhu Hao] deals with people in good faith. You should warn him to be very careful. "
In the twelfth month the emperor returned to the capital and paid a visit to the Imperial University.
Liang Ji heard about this and was furious.He had the office of the capital put out a summons for the arrest of the two men.Hu Wu's whole household was punished, and more than sixty people died.
Of all your enemies, none are greaterthan those to the north of the Yellow River, while once you havebrought the north of the River under control, then your imperial army will have gained its full strength, and all the empire willtremble before you."
You have talent and understanding; I hope you will do your best.
Chen Ji became General of the Household for All Purposes and Han Rong became Minister Herald.
If you accept what I say, Ishall not die in vain." He died at Baqiu.
For two thousand li, from Yunzhong and Wuyuan west as far as Hanyang, the Xiongnu and various Qiang have taken over territory. This is a hidden sore in our side which is festering and waiting to burst; if it is not cut away it will grow much worse.
Liu Bei followed Lu Su's advice, and he went forward to stay at Fankou in E county.
Now that the emperor had destroyed Liang Ji, he was able to take account of old favours and private friendships, and he awarded a number of enfeoffments and titles.He gave posthumous appointment as General of Chariots and Cavalry to the empress' father Deng Xiang, with enfeoffment as Marquis of Anyang.He changed the fief of the empress' mother, the Lady Xuan, to be Lady of Kunyang, while Deng Kang and Deng Bing, sons of the empress' elder brother, both became marquises.Other members of the family became colonels, or generalsof the household, and were given enormous rewards and presents, calculated by the tens of thousands.
When Cao Cao took the royal title, Yang Xun published a eulogy of his achievements and virtue.
Next morning, when Guo Tai got up, he went to the foot of Qiu Xiang's bed and bowed to him, saying, "Rather than my colleague, you are my teacher."
He ordered Xu Huang to publish Sun Quan's letter both to the men inside the siege and to Guan Yu's camp. When the defenders heard about it, their spirits were raised a hundred times. Guan Yu, however, suspected it was a trick and did not withdraw.
In this year there were constructed the Jade Sceptre Park for Bird Netting and the Park of Spiritual Jade.
Sun Ce brought histroops and defeated them all.
Wu Kuang and Zhang Zhang, officers of He Jin, were outside the palace when they heard that he had come to harm. They wanted to lead their men inside, but the gates of the palace were closed.
He used the law to bring harm to scholars and gentlemen of quality and to all those looked upon with greater respect than he was himself, while any man of ability was treated harshly and sent to exile in poor and bad territory.
The Grand Commandant Hu Guang, the Excellency over the Masses Han Yan and the Excellency of Works Sun Lang were all found guilty of subservience to the Liang clan and of failing to protect the throne.They were detained at the Watch-House of Long Life,then sentenced to the death penalty remitted by one degree, and were dismissed to become commoners.
Some time later, Li Ying was again appointed as Director of Retainers.
In the third month the Grand Commandant Huang Qiong left office.In the summer, in the fourth month the Minister of Ceremonies, Liu Ju of Pei kingdom, became Grand Commandant.
At first, they could still find rats, old bones and sinews, but then there was nothing that could be cooked and eaten.
Zhao Yan, was made Protector of the Army Within the Passes and ordered to raise twelve hundred soldiers to help in the defence of Hanzhong.
In the autumn, in the seventh month, the Excellency of Works Chong Fu left office and the Household Counsellor Chunyu Jia of Ji'nan was made Excellency of Works. The Grand Commandant Zhao Qian was dismissed and the Minister of Ceremonies Ma Midi became Grand Commandant.
As General-in-Chief, your excellency holds position above all others.It is your natural duty to bring forward men of worth and quality to fill the positions of government.
Wang Yun was furious and accused him, "Dong Zhuo, the great bandit of the empire,
When Wang Yun arrived [at the Ministry of Justice at the capital], the General-in-Chief He Jin sent in a memorial jointly with Yang Ci and Yuan Wei to plead for his life, and they obtained a remission of his charges.
Liu Biao set up schools to teach the classics, and he ordered the former Gentlemanof the Court Music Du Kui of Henan to compose ceremonial music.
Dong Zhuo sent in another memorial, "Despite my lack of merit, I have received your heavenly favour and held military command for ten years. My officers and men of every rank have long been close to me. They appreciate my generous care, and are always ready to obey my orders. I beg to take them with me to the north, to assist in the defence of the frontier."
All the commanderies and counties of Yan province now turned to Lu Bu, and only Juancheng, Fan and Dong'a remained loyal.
The Yellow Turbans were now defeated and scattered, and the remnants were dealt with by provincial and commandery governments. Thousands of people were executed in a single commandery.
"If Yuan Shang comes by the mainroad," observed Cao Cao, "we should indeed keep away. But if hecomes through the western hills, then we have him."
Zhang Huan was appointed Minister of Finance and enfeoffed as a marquis for his good work.
When Sun Jian went away on campaign he left his family at Shouchun,
and some of his clerical officers urged Chen Qiu to send his family away out of danger. Chen Qiu replied angrily, "I hold the tiger tally from my government,29 and I have been given charge of this territory. How can I concern myself with wife and children if I harm the authority of the state by doing so? The next man to make any such suggestion will be executed." Then he had great trees strung to make bows, and feathered whole lances to make arrows, and he had a device to draw the weapon and fire it. Many of the enemy were killed or wounded.
Generations of his family have displayed grace and virtue, and all the empire has received their favour; once more, how do you compare with Yuan?
The salaries of the excellencies, ministers and lesser officials were reduced, and a forced loan was made of half a year's tax income from royal fiefs and marquisates.The noble rank of secondary marquis, together with positions in the Rapid Tiger and Feathered Forest regiments, as Cavalryman Dressed in Red and as Warrior in the Encampments, and also the noble rank Quintuple Grandee, were all offered for sale by inscription, with prices atdifferent levels.
"But now one of them has suddenly asked your help, and youcan see from this [how weak they are].
Cao Cao sent the Consultant Zhang Ji to go to the west andraise the leaders within the passes, Ma Teng and his fellows. Theybrought troops to attack and destroy Zhang Cheng and his allies. They took the heads of Wei Gu, Zhang Yan and some others, butthe rest of their followers were pardoned. [344]
He promised to present them to Lü Bu, butwhen he failed to do so Lü Bu went to ask for the goods himself.
Wang Fu and eleven associates were enfeoffed as marquises for their good work.
At present, with authority to make appointments and sufficientpower to maintain your independence, you have no need for a royaltitle.
In the eighth month Huangfu Song fought the Yellow Turbans at Cangting and captured their leader Bu Si.
Sun Quan sent an open summons to call him back, while at the same time making plans with him in secret.
Guo Jia told Cao Cao, and then Cao Cao said to Xin Pi, "Can Itrust Yuan Tan? Can I be sure to defeat Yuan Shang?" "Your Excellency need have no concern about Yuan Tan'sreliability," replied Xin Pi. "You have only to consider his militarystrength.
He appointed Yuan Yan as General of the Household for All Purposes, and later transferred him until he became Minister Herald.
Liu Yao fought with Sun Ce, but his men were defeated and fled to Dantu.
but Fa Zheng replied, "There is nothing to worry about. LiuZhang will never use such methods."
An imperial edict sent the Internuncio Feng Shan to persuade the rebel Qiang scattered about in Hanyang to surrender.
Then, however, from Emperor Xiao-He onwards, relatives by marriage seized power, and eunuchs gained control of affairs. 96Rewards and punishments were issued without proper rule, bribery was a public business, worthy men and fools were mixed together, right and wrong were confused. This may be called disorder.
The emperor sought to avoid this. He made a great levy of soldiers from all directions and held manoeuvres by the Lodge of Tranquil Joy. A great platform was set up, with twelve ceremonial umbrellas on top, each a hundred feet high.
In the autumn, in the seventh month Zhang Meng the Administrator of Wuwei killed the Inspector of Yong province, Handan Shang. The provincial troops attacked and killed him.
I ask your majesty to relax the prohibitions against light or shaved coinage and put this debate about currency behind you.Listen to the songs of the people, ask an old man by the roadside about his troubles,watch the bright patterns of the sun, the moon and the stars, and take note of changes in the divisions of the hills and the currents of the rivers.The minds of the people of the empire, and the great affairs of state, will all appear clearly [in these signs] and one should never neglect them or doubt them.
A certain Zhu Gongdao happened to hear him. Stealing in bynight, he brought Jia Kui out, broke his fetters and arranged hisescape. He would not [at that time] give his name.
"If a man serves a lord,"replied Yan Wen, "he can only die for him once.
They told the Consultant Cao Cao about their plan. Cao Cao said, "Now to depose one emperor and set up another is a most unfortunate business for the empire.
Cao Cao sent the Consultant Wang Pu with an imperial message toappoint Sun Ce as a Commandant of Cavalry, granting him thesuccession to the marquisate of Wucheng, and authority asAdministrator of Kuaiji. He was ordered to join Lü Bu and Chen Yuthe Administrator of Wu commandery in operations against Yuan Shu.
Before this, when Cao Cao was at Qiao, he was afraid that thepeople of the commanderies along the Yangzi would suffer raidingby Sun Quan. He planned to bring them closer, and he discussedthe proposal with Jiang Ji, Attendant Officer of Yang province. "Once before, when Yuan Benchu [Yuan Shao] and I werefacing one another with our armies at Guandu, I shifted the inhabi tants of Yan and Boma. That way, they could not defect, and the[448] enemy did not dare attack them.
You should decline these great prizes and so keep your personal reputation intact."
Sun Sheng says: [265]Hua Xin lacked the spirit of [Bo]yi and the Four Greybeards, for[while he made no attempt to avoid responsibility] he failed tomaintain his honour as a royal minister. He lost heart at the words of a false scholar [Yu Fan] and he linked arms with a follower ofoppression and plunder [Sun Ce]. His position was taken and hisreputation was lost. What could be more shameful?
"Yuan Shao has all his army at Guandu," replied Xun Yu, "andthat is where he will settle victory and defeat with you.
I have no thought for my own interests, and no personal enmity for Dong Zhuo. "Yet you now pay attention to slander,and for no reason at all you are suspicious of me!"
"Our previous quarrel," replied Pang Ji, "that was private. Weare talking now about matters of state."
His officers wanted to build earth mounds and construct machines for an assault, but Lii Meng said, "If we make engines and earthworks, it will be days before they are ready. The city will be prepared, relief troops will arrive, and we shall not be able to manage them.
When Cao Cao heard that Sun Ce had died, he thought to take theopportunity to attack.
Both Yuan Feng and Yuan Wei became well known, and they held a number of high positions while they were still young.
As Ju Shou was about to leave, he called his clansmen together,divided his possessions among them and said, "If we survive, myauthority will certainly be recognised everywhere. If we lose, I shallnot escape with my life. The pity of it."
and he thenbrought in teachers and set up schools.
Zhang He retreated to Nanzheng, and Liu Bei went back to Chengdu.
When people came to open a lawsuit, he would tell themwhat was right and what was wrong, then send them back to think itover; so the elders of the people blamed themselves for any quarrel,and they no longer enjoyed going to law.
About this time Cao Cao sent a messenger to the province tohear court cases. Liu Ye invited him to his house,
All those present were shaken.Only the Master of Writing Lu Zhi said, "In former times, Taijia held position but lacked understanding, and the faults of [the King of] Changyi were more than a thousand, so there were reasons for the depositions.
Dong Zhuo's personal favourites were appointed only as generals of the household or colonels. They were not given important posts.
Guo Tai replied, "At night I observe the signs of the heavens. By daylight I examine the affairs of men. That which Heaven is destroying cannot be supported. I shall continue my idle wandering a few more years, and that is all."
Then Huangfu Song sent in a report to the throne, giving credit to Zhu Jun for his work, and Zhu Jun was advanced in fief to be Marquis of Xi District and was transferred to appointment as General of the Household Who Maintains the Rebels in Order.
They sent a messenger to LiuFu, Inspector of Yang province [appointed by Cao Cao] that heshould come and camp at Liyang; they could then arrange for [thewhole commandery of] Danyang to accede to him.
Yang Qiu replied, "Your crimes and wickedness are beyond description, and even death is not sufficient to wipe out the debt. And you dare talk about seniority in order to ask for some remission!"
At his house he kept a chicken ready broiled, together with an ounce of floss silk which had been soaked in wine, then dried in the sun and wrapped around the bird.He would go to the outer entrance of the tomb, soak the cloth in water so that the fragrance of the wine came out, and present the chicken with a single dou of rice and some white reeds spread underneath it.
A little while later they climbed a tower. Liu Qi ordered that the ladder be taken away, then said to Zhuge Liang, "Here we are not high enough to touch Heaven, nor low enough to reach the ground. Any words you utter will reach my ears alone. Can you not say something?"
Li Gao was extremely frightened. He had planks laid on the floor instead of the usual mats, and he changed the place of his sleeping quarters nine times a night.
If you act with virtue to follow the wishes of the empire, then even if you had no more than the ability of a common fellow, you would find no difficulty taking position as a hegemon.
Gan Ning wanted to leave, but was afraid he would not be able to make his escape.Then Su Fei spoke to Huang Zu,
In the second month on the day yisi [13 Mar], first of the month,there was an eclipse of the sun.
It is my wish to admire goodness and share its purity, and I am prepared to share the disgrace of those who hate evil. I have spoken of certain things which I believe the imperial government should be aware of. I do not understand why this should be regarded as factionalism.
and Yuan Shu was very angry. He ordered Sun Ce to attack Lu Kang and said to him, "I was confused that other time and appointed Chen Ji. I have been annoyed with myself ever since.
while the Grand Tutor Chen Fan and the General-in-Chief Dou Wu investigated other members of their faction, seeking to cleanse the court and the government.
I appreciate, however, that none of you have any concern in this affair, and there is no reason for you to share this ill fortune. Before the city falls you must take your wives and children and go."
I look upon him as a son, and you should respecthim as an elder brother."
When King Cao of WEI heard that Guan Yu had fled, he was afraid his officers might follow him in pursuit, and he did send orders post-haste to Cao Ren, just the way Zhao Yan had said.
Some of Wang Yun's Assistant Officers thought to bring matters to a crisis point, and with tears in their eyes they came to offer him a draught of poison.
The Empress He was a jealous woman. When the Beauty Wang gave birth to an imperial son, Liu Xie, in the harem apartments, she poisoned her.
Let me calculate things for you. The north is not yet settled. Ma Chao and Han Sui are still in the west of the passes, and they are a danger to Cao Cao's rear. At the same time, Cao Cao is leaving his saddled horses, and is taking boats and oars to contend with Wu and Yue. Furthermore, it is now the depths of winter, so his horses will have no fodder. He is forcing an army from central China on long marches to the region of the Yangzi and the lakes. His men have no experience of the marsh country and they will certainly get sickness.
Within a few weeks, like clouds from every direction, more than twenty thousand men and a thousand cavalry had come to join him. His authority shook the lands east of the Yangzi.
Bo Cai besieged Huangfu Song at Changshe.
So he invited Guan Yu to a meeting. Each side halted then- troops, the generals came forward a hundred paces and met alone, armed only with swords.
Before this, Sun Ce had killed Xu Gong the Administrator ofWu commandery, and Xu Gong's retainers had concealed them selves among the people in hope of avenging him.
An edict proclaimed rewards for the successful destruction of Liang Ji.Shan Chao, Xu Huang, Ju Yuan, Zuo Guan and Tang Heng were all made marquises of counties.Shan Chao had the income from twenty thousand households, while Xu Huang and the others each had more than ten thousand households.They were known by the people of the time as "the five marquises".
The Inspector of Qing province, Jiao He, had also raised troops to attack Dong Zhuo. He made every effort to join the other leaders in the march to the west, but he had prepared no defences for his own people, and even as his soldiers crossed the Yellow River the Yellow Turbans were already within his borders.38
The Administrator of Lujiang, Li Shu, had attacked and killed theInspector of Yang province Yan Xiang,52 and Mei Qian, Lei Xu andChen Lan of Lujiang each collected forces of several ten thousandsbetween the Yangzi and the Huai.
Before this, Zhuge Liang of Langye had been living at Longzhong in Xiangyang.He always compared himself to Guan Zhong and Yue Yi,
Sun Jian went on to Luyang to join Yuan Shu,
?
He enfeoffed Quan Zong as Marquis of Yanghua Village.
Yuan Shu was concerned, and he did not send supplies for the army.
And some of the leaders asked the director of the funeral, and he replied, "There was a scholar came here earlier, with coarse and simple clothing, weeping for grief. He did not write his name."
Liu Bei made plans with Dong Cheng, with the Colonel of theChang River Regiment Chong Ji and the generals Wu Zilan andWang Fu.
but Tian Feng pressed his argu ment. Believing he would upset the morale of the army, Yuan Shaohad him chained up.
Liu Bei's troops amounted to several ten [269>] thousandmen, and he sent messengers to contact Yuan Shao with a view tojoint operations.
Shan Bing was suspicious and would not accept the edict, so Wang Fu struck and killed him. He also killed Yin Xun. Then he released Zheng Li and brought his soldiers back to seize the Dowager and take her seal and ribbon.
Cao Cao led troops into Dong, attacked Bo Rao at Puyang and defeated him.
but Liu Zhang said, "Father and son, my family has been in this province for more than twenty years, yet we have shown the people neither grace nor virtue.
If you attack now, without waiting for reinforcements, then the booty you will gain will be so great that the few pieces you have lost will not be worth remem-bering."
and the clothing and food for his wife and family were sufficient and no more.
There have been no reports from the provinces or commanderies, so where does Liu Tao get his information?
Before this, Wei Feng of Pei state had made a great show to impress people. Everyone at Ye admired his brilliance and the Chancellor of State of WEI Zhong Yao appointed him as Senior Clerk in the Department of the West.
"Now the General of the Left [Liu Bei] is under siege in Hanzhong by Xiahou Yuan, Guan Yu is in Nan commandery and our lord [Sun Quan] is close upon him.
Liu Biao, furious, called him a traitor. Calling a full assemblyof his officials, he drew up soldiers, took his Staff of Authority andintended to execute him.
"I have been a Gentleman for fifteen years, and have seen and heard for myself all that Zhu Yu has done; it is indeed more than August Heaven can pardon.
Dong Fu and the Prefect of the Grand Granary Zhao Wei both left their offices and followed Liu Yan into Shu.
Li Jue's wife, however, loved her son, so negotiations came to a halt.
Cao Cao collected five thousand men who had formerly served Han Sui, Ma Chao and the other generals [of the northwest], and he put them under the command of Yin Shu, as General Who Pacifies Disorder. The Administrator of [You]fufeng,
I go to bed, but I cannot sleep; I eat but my stomach is only half filled. "I am truly concerned that your attendants [the eunuchs] become closer to you every day, and that the loyal words [of your ministers] steadily lose influence. Inside, troubles mount up. Outside, difficulties become constantly more serious.
"Hou Can, younger brother of the Regular Attendant Hou Lan, has shown the utmost greed and cruelty, and has brought upon himself misfortune and destruction.
When Chen Deng saw Cao Cao he described Lü Bu's braveryand lack of forethought, how he was erratic in alliances, and howCao Cao should plan to take him early.
The Wu and Ji Colonel and the Chief Clerk of the Western Regions each raised troops to assist in establishing Dingxing, the hostage prince, as king. The number of his people was barely a thousand.
Zhu Gai, a soldier of Jing province, led a mutiny and joined the Guiyang bandits under Hu Lan to attack that commandery.
When Lü Meng came to the capital, Sun Quan asked him, "Who could take your place?"
Huan Dian always rode a piebald horse and there was a saying about him in the capital:Walking, walking, better watch your step,Beware the Clerk on the piebald horse.
In the summer, in the fifth month an edict granted King Cao of WEI the banners and flags of the Son of Heaven. When he went out or in the road should be cleared of all other traffic.
The reason I can face you, and the reason you can deal with me, is because we share a moral code and do not change it.
The Grand Prolonger of Autumn Cao Jie, Marquis of Huarong, died. The Regular Attendant Zhao Zhong took his place as Grand Prolonger of Autumn.
Will your majesty say what sort of a man is Xu You? asked Du Xi.
Guo Tai made skilled judgements of individual moral conduct, but he never engaged in controversial discussion of affairs of state. For this reason, though he lived in turbulent and corrupt times, peril and misfortune did not reach him.
Liu Ba, however, went north to Duke Cao of WEI, who appointed him a Senior Clerk and sent him to manage the takeover of Changsha, Lingling and Guiyang.
In the sixth month on the day gengren [14 Aug], last of the month,there was an eclipse of the sun.
Why do you question it?" Deng Xi claimed to be ill, andwent away.
On the day gengzi [?gengwu=23 Apr] the Yellow Turban of Nanyang, Zhang Mancheng, attacked and killed the Administrator Chu Gong.
Cao Cao collected Yuan Shao's papers, including letters from menat Xu city and within his army. He burnt them all, saying, "WhenYuan Shao was strong, even I was not sure of myself. How muchmore is this true for my men."
Lu Bu had attacked Juancheng but could not capture it, and he went back west to camp at Puyang.
Speaking casually with Liu Bei, Cao Cao observed, "You and Iare the only brave men in the empire. People like Benchu [YuanShao] simply don't count."
The Administrator of Nanyang, Dongli Gun, and his Officer of Merit Ying Yu fought fiercely and managed to escape. Hou Yin sent horsemen after them, and arrows came from every direction. As Ying Yu protected Dongli Gun with his body, he was woundedseven times and died. Hou Yin's troopers captured Dongli Gun and brought him back.
I am frequently unwell. I ask to bring some of my forces back to Jianye: we can say it is because of my health. When Guan Yu hears, he will surely call his guards up to Xiangyang.
Before this, Lu Su had urged Sun Quan that so long as Cao Caolived he should stay in harmony with Guan Yu and maintain the alliance. They should never break off with him.
My Registrar, Yang Hui, shall act as my Cheng Ying."
To the south of the city there were bandits who had attacked people, and to the north was a woman who had killed her child.
When Cao Cao came to this region, Xu Chu brought his forcesto join him. "Here," said Cao Cao, "is my Fan Kuai!"37 He immedi ately appointed Xu Chu as his Commandant and guard at night,while all his retainers were made Tiger Warriors.
Liu Bo, King of Rencheng, died. He had no sons and his kingdom was abolished.
When his treasure was assessed, it filled more than three hundred wagons, all laden with gold and silver, brocade and silk.
The Controller of the Army Du Xi and Xiahou Yuan's Major Guo Huai of Taiyuan collected the scattered troops and issued a statement to all the army, "General Zhang is a celebrated leader of our state, and Liu Bei is afraid of him.
Before this, when military commanders were sent on campaign it frequently happened that the eunuchs accused them of wasting or losing part of the army supplies, and they were often punished for this.Feng Gun therefore put in a request that one of the Regular Attendants should act as supervisor of the supplies for his army.
Dong Cheng and Zhang Yang wanted to have the emperor return to Luoyang, but Yang Feng and Li Le would not agree. All the generals were now suspicious of one another.
A certain Zhang Fan was a wealthy merchant in Wan.24 He had long been in close contact with the members of the imperial harem, and he was extremely good at engraving objects of art and items of fancy. He had occasionally given them as bribes to the eunuchs, and in this way he had a splendid position and was able to use his influence arrogantly and unlawfully.
I ask permission to take a message of condolence to Liu Biao's sons. While I am there I can show our sympathies and make friends with the men who hold authority in their army, and I shall urge Liu Bei to collect Liu Biao's forces and join us against Cao Cao. Liu Bei will certainly be pleased and will accept the invitation.
Then his treasury was empty and he could no longer maintainhis position. Burning his palace buildings, he fled to his followersChen Jian and Lei Bo in the Qian hills, but they turned him away.
Cao Cao also fled east, disguised and with a false name. As he travelled through Zhongmou, however, the headman of a village became suspicious: he arrested Cao Cao and sent him to the county office.
A plain and upright man, he became bitter at such treatment.Before very long his anger and frustration caused an ulcer to break out, and he died.
Add the facts that military affairs are not yet resolved, while in every part of the world there are scattered and homeless refugees, then this is a time that the ruler should bear an anxious heart and a care- worn countenance, sitting up [into thesmall hours] and waiting on the developments each day may bring.How can it be right to raise the banners and display the panoply of war, exciting the heart with the show of horses and chariots?
By nature, however, Dong Zhuo was obstinate and over-bearing. On one occasion Lü Bu had some slight disagreement with him, and Dong Zhuo seized a hand-axe and threw it at him. Lü Bu ducked quickly and it missed. He changed his tune and apologised, so Dong Zhuo's anger left him,
To take the ruler's place is a serious duty. To be master of a state is a fearful task.
"Unless you deal with Lü Bu first," advised Xun Yu, "it will notbe easy to make plans for the north of the River."
however, he browbeat and ridiculed him. Claiming that he wished to inspect the regalia, he borrowed the imperial [144] credentials and the Staff of Authority from Ma Midi, then kept them by force and refused to hand them back. He ordered a dozen of his men to bully Ma Midi so that he would be compelled to give him higher office.
The Yellow Turbans of Guangyang killed the Inspector of You province Guo Xun and the Administrator Liu Wei.
Once Xu is captured, then we holdthe emperor and can attack Cao Cao in his name, while Cao Caobecomes an outlaw.
Among all Heaven's people, Xing Yong is the first to appreciate the situation, observed Tian Chou.
If he sees that I have very few, he will paylittle attention and will not attack. If you add to my troops, however,then if he passes by he is sure to attack, and if he attacks he willcertainly win. Both you and I would lose strength. Please have nodoubts."
He had already prepared a chariot with an escort of cavalry, but Tian Chou said, "The roads are blocked and there are robbers and bandits everywhere. If you give me an official commission, everyone will notice me.
Qin Jie the Administrator of Nanyang killed Han Zhong, and the remaining rebels chose Sun Xia as their leader. He went back to camp in Wan,
Liu Zhang sent his officers Liu Gui, Leng Bao, Zhang Ren,Deng Xian, Wu Yi and others to oppose Liu Bei.14 They were alldefeated and came back to hold Mianzhu,15 while Wu Yi went toLiu Bei's camp to surrender.
however, has not long held command ofYuan Shao's soldiers and he has yet not had time to get the bestfrom them. If we attack we can defeat him."
Dong Zhuo spoke with the emperor, but could gain no clear account of what had happened. Then he talked to the King of [19] Chenliu and asked about the causes of the misfortune and disorder. The king described events from first to last, with nothing left out,
Gao Gan sought aid from the Xiongnu, but the Shanyu would not receive him.
Part 3 of the reign of Emperor Huan followed by Part 1A of the reign of Emperor Ling Yongkang 1: 167 AD 10 February 167 - 29 January 168
Cao Cao discussed the question with the marquises and militarycommanders. All agreed that the Imperial Chancellor should be raised in honour to become Duke of the State, while the NineDistinctions of imperial favour should show his special merit.
He remembered his last promises to Jingsheng [Liu Biao], and all the army respected him for his feelings. He refused to abandon the people that came to join him, and he was prepared to share their misfortunes.
I have been in this post for ten days already, and personally I was rather worried I might be held at fault for the delay. I hardly expected to be criticised for acting too quickly against a criminal.
Wang Yun had spoken earlier with Shisun Rui about a special edict to pardon Dong Zhuo's followers, but then he became uncertain about the idea, saying, "
combined their forces to attack Yingtao, but Ox-horn was struck by an arrow and mortally wounded. Before he died, he ordered [193] his followers to obey Flying Swallow as their leader, and Flying Swallow changed his surname to Zhang.
If you want something foryourself, you can rise up and take advantage of their difficulties.Even if you have no ambitions of your own, you should certainlychoose one of them to follow.
Just before Chengdu surrendered, Xu Jing was planning to cross the wall and join the besiegers. Liu Bei accord ingly thought little of him and was reluctant to give him an appoint ment.
Admiring his loyalty and courage, the tribesmen did him no harm, but sent him back to Hanyang.
The court sent the Director of Retainers Zhong Yao and the Inspector of Liang province Wei Duan to make peace between them, and Ma Teng was called in to camp at Huaili.
Whenever Guan Ning saw Gongsun Du, he would speak only of the classics and histories, and would make no mention of currentaffairs. When he went back into the hills he talked only about the Odes and the History, and he carried out and practiced worship with the sacrificial utensils. He refused to see any person who was not a scholar.
In the autumn the Yellow River broke its banks in Jincheng and flooded over twenty.
As the man himself is gone, another hundred lives cannot redeem him.
and Yang Feng set his camp at Liang. Han Xian and Dong Cheng stayed together on guard.
Xiahou Yuan turned again to attack Gaoping and the Chuge [group of the Xiongnu].
The General-in-Chief Liang Ji had an old quarrel with Chen Gui, and he slandered him as a man who had harmed the dignity of the state, taken false credit for his achievements, and had actually given the Xiongnu no cause to fear him.So Chen Gui was recalled, and Chong Gao was made General on the Liao.
In the spring, in the first month on the day jiwei,there was an amnesty for the empire.
So Jia Xu called in the chieftains, gave them wine and food and promised them fiefs and rewards. They all went away.Li Jue was now isolated and weak, a
Thehigh officials impeached him, for "Standing aloof against the right Way of action, and wilfully using this opportunity to establish a petty name for virtue. He should be dismissed and punished."
"At the moment, you and your brother [He Miao] both control strong forces. Your subordinate and divisional commanders are all brave men of fine reputation, fully prepared to carry out your orders. Everything is in your hands, and this is an occasion sent by heaven. Y
he let nothing slip by him, and he never allowed Cao Zhi any latitude. As a result, the two did not get on.
With every person in the household competing for the death penalty, the local offices could not come to a decision. The matter was referred to the court, and in the end, by imperial degree, Kong Bao was found to be responsible.
In the winter, in the tenth month the barbarians of Wuling rebelled and raided Jiangling [capital of Nan commandery].Li Su, the Administrator of Nan commandery, ran away.His Registrar Hu Shuang seized the bridle of his horse and protested, "The barbarians can see that the commandery has no preparations for defence against them, so they are only too eager to take advantage of such an opportunity, and they will certainly attack."
Quite unperturbed, Chen Deng replied with dignity, "When Isaw Lord Cao, I said that keeping you was like caring for a tiger: itshould be given plenty of meat, or it will bite [219] its master. TheDuke replied,
and on the night of bingshen [22 May] he brought soldiers to attack Li Jue's gates. An arrow came through the curtains of the emperor's tent, and another hit Li Jue in the right ear.
Before the documents in the case had been sorted out, there was an amnesty of pardon. Zhang Pan, however, was not prepared to leave the prison, and sat there in his cangue and his fetters.
When Huangfu Gui arrived, he sent in reports with detailed accounts of their crimes;some were punished and others dismissed.
In the winter, in the tenth month the Excellency of Works Zhou Jing left office. The Minister of Ceremonies Liu Mao was appointed Excellency of Works. Liu Mao was a son of Liu Kai.
Cao Cao's army was small, his supplies were exhausted, histroops were tired and ill, his people were troubled by the taxationand levies and many turned to Yuan Shao. Cao Cao was worried,and he wrote to Xun Yu that he was thinking of a retreat to Xu city,so that Yuan Shao would be compelled to fight him there.
As a result of this new defeat of Li Jue and his fellows, Dong Cheng and the others thought to continue their journey.
At the present time my name appears upon your service list, I have handed you my pledge, and you are the only person tocommand me. You may send me through fire and water and I shalldie without complaint.
Cui Yan and Mao Jie brought forward the honest and the true and dismissed the flowery and the false; they advanced the quiet and the humble; they repressed the flatterers and politicians.
Later, however, he opposed the imperial commands, so Lord Cao has taken his place. He is willingto arrange for you to receive title as Shanyu from the proper author ity.
The administration of an enlightened ruler makes careful selection of loyal worthy men and then employs them. Whether they serve in the court or outside, if they do well they are rewarded and if they have faults they are punished. There is no opportunity for private interest, laws are maintained without difficulty, and the world receives excellent government.
Cao Cao sighed and said, "If I had had you earlier, the empirewould have been no problem."
When Sun Quan showed this to his ministers, they all trembled and turned pale.
East of the passes, observed Wang Hong, "the loyal armies are bubbling like a cauldron. They wanted to destroy Dong Zhuo, and now that he is dead it should be easy to deal with his followers.
Sun Quan occupies the east of the Yangzi, and three of his family have held power there already.The terrain is difficult to approach, its people are loyal, and he has worthy and able men in his service. You may ally with him for mutual support, but you cannot make plans against him.
Sun Ce was concerned that Liu Xun had acquired such a strongarmy. He pretended humility and wrote to Liu Xun to say, "TheShangliao clans have often raided my commandery. I want to attackthem, but the approach is difficult.
Fan Pang had knelt to receive his mother's instruction, and he bowed to bid her farewell.
"The leaders within the passes," replied Xun Yu, "are numberedby the score. No-one can bring them together. Han Sui and Ma Tengare the only strong ones,
On the day jiazi [22 Nov] the emperor himself came out to the army and stood below the great umbrellas, while the General-in- chief He Jin took place below the smaller umbrellas.
Cai Yong advised as follows: "Military campaigns of punishment have been carried out since ancient times, and they are always important.
Cao Cao had suspicions about the people in the areas of Jing province which had been over-run [by Guan Yu] and also about those in the military colonies along the Han.He planned to shift all of them.
Jiang Jijiang said, "My elder brother's virtues and his age are far greater than mine. He is the treasure of our family and a leader of the nation. Let me receive your blows, but I beg you to spare my brother's life."
I am afraid the enemy have a great army, said Cao Cao, "and Xu Huang's force is in difficulty."
Wu Ju, however, madeonly a false submission, and secretly opposed him. Bu Zhi had WuJu come to him, then cut his head off. His reputation and authoritymade everyone tremble.
He Xun replied, "Your subject has heard that the former kings were brilliant in their virtue and took no thought of weapons,
"If you receive the court now," replied Ju Shou, "you will be acting with justice to fulfil the needs of the time. Unless you decide quickly, someone else will be ahead of you."
When Fu Xie attacked the Yellow Turbans he gained great success, and it was felt that he deserved enfeoffment. Zhao Zhong, however, made false accusations against him.
Ashamed to have lost his insignia, however, Ma Midi vomited blood and died.
"In the end, however, it is only by extraordinary acts that onecan build exceptional achievement. It is for you to decide the bestpolicy."
You will be perfectly secure, and can look for yet greater things."
Furthermore,the man who [254] controls the army outside should not be privy todecisions taken at the inner council."
"You understand half the matter," replied Zhuge Liang, "but not the whole.
"Should I be destroyed, moreover, the whole realm will be indanger. I am not prepared to give up my life for a meaninglessreputation.
Liu Biao wassurprised and asked him what was wrong. "In earlier times," repliedLiu Bei, "I never left the saddle, and my thighs were thin.
Though Chencang is small, its defences are strong and in good order; it will not be easy to capture.
Furthermore, the rain and floods have helped us move in, but if we stay too long the water will go down and the return will be difficult. It is my humble opinion that the situation can become dangerous.
Trained soldiers were raised from the empire,11 and the General of the Household of the North Lu Zhi was sent to attack Zhang Jue. HuangfU Song, as General of the Household on the Left, and the General of the Household on the Right Zhu Jun were sent to attack the Yellow Turbans of Yingchuan.
In the autumn, in the seventh month, the Colonel of the Archers Who Shoot at a Sound Ma Midi became Grand Commandant.
The Yellow Turbans of Qing province plundered in Yan. Liu Dai was going to attack them, but Bao Xin the Chancellor of Jibei argued, "The bandits number a million and people are frightened. Our officers and men lack fighting spirit and cannot face them.
He also reported most favourably on the Marquis of Wansui Village, Xun Yu, and in the third month Xun Yu's fief was increased by a thousand households.
This miserable fellow Xu You, is it worth your while to exercise your military genius against him?"
Besides this, the number of women chosen for your harem has reached the thousands;they eat meat and they wear fine silk, while their cosmetics, powder and eye-shadow are more costly than anyone can measure.
Paying no attention, Dian Wei said to his men, "When the enemy are ten paces away, report it."
He would not accept the argument, and so Sun Ce broke off with him.
As Cao Cao brought his army back to Guandu, Yuan Shao nowconsidered an attack on Xu city.
If we keep quiet, on the other hand, then Sun Quan gets what he wants. That is not the best plan.
Then Guo Tai said to him, "At first I could see only your outward appearance; now, however, I appreciate your true nature."So he took Wei Zhao as his friend, and treated him with the utmost affection.
The emperor, however, considered that although Xiang Kai's words were extravagant and excessive, he had [77] nonetheless relied in each case upon signs from Heaven and other portents. For this reason he was not executed, but was sent to serve sentence as robber-guard.
Those who had charge of palace documents first advised Zhu Yu, [the eunuch who was] Clerk for All Purposes at the Palace of Prolonged Joy, [about the memorial].Zhu Yu opened the memorial in secret and without authorisation. He cursed and said, "Any palace officials who have abused power may certainly be executed. But what crimes have we others committed? Yet we and all our families are now to be massacred!"
Some people found a jade seal in the ground, and his followerswanted to honour Zhang Lu as King of Hanning.
The matter was referred for debate to officials of the Four Offices and scholars of the Imperial University competent to discuss the issue.
The Xianbi brought out Zhao Bao's mother so that he could see her. Zhao Bao called in sorrow to his mother, "As your most unworthy son, I sought to earn a salary so that I might offer you constant care. I had no idea of bringing misfortune upon you. Formerly I was your son, but now I am the servant of the state. My sense of honour will not permit me to follow private affection at the expense of the dictates of loyalty. I would die ten thousand deaths if only I could be spared this wrongful act."
Truly, if youtake this occasion to support the emperor and follow the expect ations of the people, it will match the will of Heaven. "To follow the cause of justice and so make the empire submit,that is a great plan, and to support the loyal cause and so attracttalented men, that is great virtue.
That family has been spreading favour for four generations, so they have clients and officials who have served under them throughout the empire. If Yuan Shao calls up fighting men and raises an army, then bold warriors will join him in rebellion and you will hold nothing east of the mountains.
Once you have dealt with Lu Bu, you can make an alliance in the south with [Liu Yao of] Yang province so as to attack Yuan Shu and move towards the Huai and the Si.
On these three points you are at a disadvantage: how can you cope with him?
but Xun Yusaid, "Yuan Shao has just been defeated, and his followers will beunhappy. You should take advantage of his difficulties and settlewith him for good.
As a result of this, Cao Jie, Zhu Yu and their fellows regained some of their influence and power,
In the spring, in the first month on the day guizhou [7 Feb] there was an amnesty for the empire.
Though our forces may be strong we shall achieve nothing if the wrong man holds command.
Liu Bei besieged the city for several weeks, and then he sent his Gentleman of the General Staff Jian Yong of Zhuo commandery to go in and talk with Liu Zhang.
When hereturned he praised the emperor and the virtue of Lord Cao, andurged Liu Biao to send his sons to enter service.
The two men left, but they did no more than collect their own troops and return [to their home country].
The emperor again flew into a rage.The chief officials now reported that [their conduct could be considered] Great Iniquity.
Then Fan Chou planned to take an army east out of the passes,and he asked Li Jue for additional troops.
When the army returned home, good work was discussed and rewards were given.
"Then came the trouble with Dong Zhuo, and I raised loyaltroops.
I am used to isolation and danger, and from my humble observation of commandery leadership over the last twenty or thirty years, from Niaoshu to Dongdai the problem of rebellion is always the same.
Dong Zhuo asked Cai Yong what he thought of the proposal."Your Excellency's majestic virtue, how truly imposing!" said Cai Yong.
He reinforced the walls ofthe cities and prepared great stocks of wood and stone, ready fordefence in war.
The loyalman has no match, but the proud are soon defeated.
Instead, however, Yan Wen faced the city and called out,"A great army will be here in no more than three days. Fight yourhardest until it comes." Everyone in the city wept for joy and criedout: "Ten thousand years!"
But just as Zhang Wen could not use my advice, so Zhou Shen could not use Sun Jian's, and in the end they were defeated and turned back.
Keeping their attentionthere, he quietly sent Xu Huang and Zhu Ling, with [424] four thousand horse and foot, over the Puban Crossing to establish abridgehead west of the Yellow River.
Zheng Hun also sent officers and people who were generousand trustworthy to make proclamation in the hills and valleys.Those who had run away came back again,
The Wuhuan had taken advantage of the disturbances in the empire, and made raids which kidnapped more than a hundred thousand Chinese families. Yuan Shao had set up their chief men as Shanyu, and he pretended that the daughters of his personal followers were his own children, and gave them away as wives for the barbarian chiefs.
Your servant Sima Guang remarks:The Book of Changes claims: "The superior man of humility and merit will maintain his success to the end and will receive good fortune." Shisun Rui had achievement but did not boast of it, and so he preserved his life. May not that be called wisdom?
On the day yiyou [10 Oct] the Grand Commandant Liu Yu was appointed Grand Marshal and enfeoffed as Marquis of Xiangfei.
In plain clothing and a linen cap, he called upon Zhou Yuas if he was making a private visit.
The best thing to do is leave the baggage behind and make a forced march with light troops. That way, you take them by surprise."
The Registrar was sent to receive Zhang Xi, and three sets ofmessengers were despatched,
An edict re-appointed Chen Fan as Minister of the Household, while Yang Bing became Intendant of Henan.
Qiao Xuan, however, looked at them angrily and cried, "These are wicked men and evildoers. How can I let banditry loose upon the state for the sake of one child's life?" He ordered them to attack, and his son was killed in the fighting.
Accepting this argument, Cao Cao sent a messenger to Zhang Yang, Administrator of Henei, asking him to open the road west to Chang'an. Zhang Yang refused.
When Gao Gan was dead, Xun Yu recommended Zhongchang Tong as a Gentleman of the Masters of Writing.
Then the fightingmen will become steadily weaker, civilian officials and people willbecome stronger, and we shall strengthen ourselves at the expenseof our enemies."
Cheng Yu also sent a detachment of cavalry to hold the CangtingCrossing, and when Chen Gong arrived he could advance no further.
but the Inspector Liang Gu was frightened and thought of killing Su Zhenghe in order to avoid the responsibility [of impeaching such a high official]. He asked the advice of the Chief Clerk of Hanyang, He Xun of Dunhuang. Su Zhenghe had once done He Xun a bad turn,
In the summer, in the fourth month on the day dingsi [miswritten for xinsi, 22 May],when the emperor had been ill and was just recovered, there was a great assembly at the Weiyang Apartments.
Cao Cao felt that Kong Rong was beginning to go too far, and he disliked him still more.
While Cao Cao was on campaign in the west, a rebellion by TianYin and Su Bo of Hejian troubled You and Ji provinces. TheGeneral of the Household for All Purposes Cao Pi wanted to go inperson to attack them,
Your servant Sima Guang remarks:Shuxiang had the saying, "When a state is about to perish, there will be many new enactments."
He treated him with great courtesy, allowed him to retain all his troops, and appointed him Administrator of Jiangxia.
There were few soldiers and no reserves of food in the city, but Fu Xie held firm.
Cao Cao faced and attackedhim, and Shen Pei was defeated and forced back.
Kou Rong was afraid he would not escape [this combination of hostility] and he [sought to] go back to the palace to plead his case.
On the day wwww [17 Aug] the Minister of Ceremonies Yang Biao was made Grand Commandant with control of the Secretariat.
You pretend that you will submit and obey, but in fact you have not made up your mind. Time is pressing: unless you make a decision, misfortune may come at any moment."
And before this, the Chancellor of Pengcheng, Xue Li, driven out by Tao Qian, had set camp at Moling.Zhai Rong was greedy for the wealth and goods of Guangling, so he murdered Zhao Yu at a drinking party, let loose his soldiers to plunder far and wide, then crossed the Yangzi to join Xue Li. Later he killed him too.
Cao Cao said, "We can still manage for a year."
Cao Jie was transferred to be Commandant of the Guards of the Palace of Prolonged Joy and was enfeoffed as Marquis of Yuyang.
Xun You and Guo Jia said, "Lü Bu is brave, but he has no senseof planning. He has fought you several times and has always beendriven back.
In the intercalary [fifth] month on the day gengchen [24 Jul], last of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.
While the great affair is yet not settled, it is my duty to seek good servants for you. Could I conceal a worthy man just because of a private quarrel?"
Then LiuQi died, and Sun Quan had Liu Bei take over as Governor of Jingprovince. Zhou Yu handed over all the territory south of theYangzi to Liu Bei.
When the rebels hear your powerful army is approaching, they will unite against you. Men from the border country are excellent fighters, and it will be hard to match their attacks. In contrast, our men have been called up only recently, and the officers and soldiers are not used to one another. If some trouble should appear within our ranks it will be too late for regrets.
Then Chen Qiu put forward the following document: "From the time the late dowager came to the Fragrant Chambers, she showed the virtues of intelligence and motherly feeling. When she encountered unfavourable times, she established our present +sagacious and intelligent ruler, and so she maintained the ancestral temple [of the imperial clan]. That achievement was most valuable.
"Great teachers of the past always put emphasis on followinghuman nature.
Ma Chao had Yan Wen brought below the walls and wanted tomake him tell the people inside that there was no help coming fromthe east.
"Why do you say that?"asked the emperor.
In the sixth month the Inspector of Jing province Wang Min attacked Zhao Ci and killed him.
The provinces and commanderies were crowded with fighting men,
the Annals of Emperor Xian(1 February, 192 - 18 February 1931)
On the day gengwu [24 Sep] Zhang Rang, Duan Gui and others were in difficulty and distress. Leading the Little Emperor and the King of Chenliu, with several dozen men on foot they went out the Gu Gate and came by night to the Xiaoping Crossing. They [left in such haste they] could not take the six seals, and none of the high ministers were able to accompany them.Only the Master of Writing Lu Zhi and the Head of the Central Precinct of Henan Min Gong came by night to the Yellow River.
So Cao Cao recommended Zhong Yao as Palace Attendant withconcurrent appointment as Director of [215] Retainers, bearing theStaff of Authority to command all the armies within the passes. Hewas given particular instructions to act [on his own initiative]unimpeded by rules and procedures.
Taishi Ci, from the same commandery as Liu Yao, had come to him from Donglai. As Sun Ce was approaching, someone suggested Taishi Ci be given a senior command,
He divided Liaodong to form Liaoxi and Zhongliao commanderies and appointed an Administrator to each of them,54 [59] while across the sea he collected all the counties of Donglai and set up an Inspector of Ying province.
An amnesty was proclaimed,25 but Cheng Jin executed Zhang Fan regardless, and he also arrested and killed more than two hundred of Zhang Fan's clansmen and followers.26 He then reported his actions to the throne.
Then he brokethrough the siege lines, galloped his horse to the walls and called tothe men above. The guards drew him up with a rope, and so he gotin.
Zhang Liao said, "Our lord is on campaign far away, and by the time help comes the enemy will surely have destroyed us.
On the other hand, Yuan is an old friend and a sworn ally. Here is the right plan for this moment: cede Ji province to Yuan. He will certainly be grateful to you, and Gongsun Zan cannot contest him.
The emperor was furious with Zhang Rang, but Zhang Rang kowtowed and begged for pardon, and in the end he was able to avoid any punishment.
He found Xu Xuan guilty, sentenced him to public execution and had his corpse displayed afterwards.
The Palace Attendant Liu Yu, who had long been expert in astrology, was very concerned at this, and he sent in a letter to the Dowager, saying, "I note that according to books of divination the gates of the palace should be kept closed.[This is a time when] military and civil officials are at a disadvantage, and evil men are at the side of the ruler. I would wish you to take urgent measures to guard against it."
Ma Chao and the others several times challenged him tobattle, but he would not accept.
Whenever Zhuge Liang went to Pang Degong's house he would go forward alone and make his bow at the foot of hisdivan.Pang Degong never objected.
Qianwan, King of the Di, rebelled to join Ma Chao and campedat Xingguo. Xiahou Yuan led his army back.
As for the people, who needs to consult them? If any prove reluctant, I shall set my soldiers onto them, and I could make them go all the way to the sea!"
His influence spread wide like a net, but the meshes wereextremely loose.
In the spring in the second month on the day bingxu [?] the Loyal Marquis of Kang District, Huang Qiong, died.
Duke Cao of WEI had three of his daughters taken into theemperor's harem as Honoured Ladies.
The Chancellor of Beihai, Kong Rong, said to Liu Bei, "Yuan Gonglu, is he a man to care for the state? Can he ever forget his lineage?
Xun You said, "Despite all the activity elsewhere, Liu Biao hasdone nothing but hold his position between the Yangzi and the Han.It is clear that he has no broader ambitions. The Yuan, on the otherhand, hold the territory of four provinces, with almost half a millionmen under arms.
Duan Wei and the others, to punish Li Jue. They killed himand destroyed his family.1 Duan Wei was appointed General WhoGives Tranquillity to the South and enfeoffed as Marquis of MinDistrict.
Before this, when the commander of one of Gongsun Zan's outlyingforts was besieged by enemies, Gongsun Zan sent no relief. He said,"If I send aid to one of them, my officers will always expect supportand will be less anxious to fight."
Lü Bu, however, presumed upon his credit with the Yuan clan and allowed his soldiers to plunder and rob,
Some sold their property and left their homes to follow him. The pilgrims blocked the roads, and more than ten thousand of them became ill and died before they reached him.
But at the present time official positions are mistaken and confused, petty men gain advancement through flattery;wealth and property are publicly misused, and the authority of the government declines further every day.When the documents [of imperial decrees] one foot long are issued without proper care,this shows that the emperor does not want to act as a judge!"
"But now Yuzhou is acting selfishly. He glosses over facts, he offends virtue and he disregards good conduct. He has already put his hand on the western province, and now he wants to take Jing territory as well. Even the most ordinary fellow would be ashamed, still more so a ruler who should arrange and order men and affairs!"
and I was the man who killed Dong Zhuo. Since I came east, however, not one of the leaders there has treated me well, and all seek to kill me."
When acupuncture was applied, Sun Quan was miserable for him.
And by the time Cheng Yu came to Dong'a the magistrate there, Zao Zhi of Yingchuan, had already taken command and had trained the people to guard the walls and hold firm. So Cheng Yu managed to keep all three cities safe for Cao Cao.
"A man who acts dishonourably," replied He Kui, "damages only himself How can he injure others?
One of the cavalrymen of the attendant offices of the Yellow Gateskicked angrily at Chen Fan and said, "Die, you old devil!
At this time, however, the proscription of the men of Faction extends to the five degrees of relationship. This does not accord with the words of the canon, and it is in conflict with the established and regular models of conduct."
"Furthermore, the terms of some officers appointed to these posts have been restricted to [a certain number of] months or years. The positions then lie vacant, the region for ten thousand l is desolate and empty, and there is no control of affairs.
Now Zhang Huan is an official of Han with military appointment.He has held command of an army for two years, but has failed to pacify the bandits. He has the vain hope that with extravagant words, and by laying down arms, he may cajole an evil foe into surrender. But he is full of false excuses and empty arguments, unreliable and without a single item of proof.
Ma Teng and Han Sui were defeated and fled, and Fan Chou pursued them to Chencang. Han Sui said to Fan Chou, "Though we may be at war, we have no personal quarrel
West of the camp was a large dyke, with thick woods south of it. Cao Cao hid soldiers behind the dyke and drew up only half his force in the open.
And now it is proposed that we should use the common people against this horde. The imperial authority will be disgraced among the outer barbarians. Even if everything goes as it is claimed it will, this is nonetheless a source of danger. And how much worse will it prove if the fighting does not go according to plan!"
The Inspector of Jing province, Hu Xiu, and the Administrator of Nanxiang, Fu Fang, both surrendered.
Sun Jian rode fast during the night to see Yuan Shu, drew on the ground to show his plans, and said, "The reasons I have taken service with you are that above I am attacking a rebel for the emperor, while below I give some help to your family in a private feud.
An imperial edict called Zhang Huan to become Minister of Finance, and Huangfu Gui was again appointed as General on the Liao to replace him.
I cannot compare with him, replied Han Fu.
The General of the Household Xu Dan of Danyang, one of Liu Bei's officers, opened the gates and received him.
When the powerful heard of this, they were all extremely nervous,
Later, there was an old man who left a sword on the road, and a man passing by saw it and stayed by it.
When Sun Quan heard that Liu Bei had gone to the west, he sentships to collect his sister, and she planned to take Liu Bei's son Shanback to Wu. Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun brought soldiers to interceptthem on the [Yangzi] river and had Liu Shan go back with them.[432]
In former times the wet-nurse Zhao Rao was honoured before all the empire, but she was a slanderer and a flatterer and displayed excessive pride. Then there was the case of Huo Yu, servant at the gate of the Palace of Perpetual Joy, who relied upon his influence with authority, and was constantly involved in wrongful dealings.
At one time he had asked to marry the daughter of Li Gao, former Administrator of Runan, but he was refused. So he led his officers and soldiers to Li Gao's house, kidnapped the girl, then shot and killed her for the fun of it.
Xun Yu had always acted honourably, his conduct was uprightand he was wise in counsel. He loved to recommend worthy menand to promote scholars. All the people of the time mourned hisdeath.
Liu Yu and Gongsun Zan had long been on bad terms. Gongsun Zan had often attacked Yuan Shao, and though Liu Yu forbade him he could not enforce his orders. He therefore reduced the supplies sent to Gongsun Zan.
Bing Yuan had strict principles, and he would express himselfclearly to set things right; everyone from Gongsun Du down was wary of him.
Fei Zhan, a leader of bandits in Danyang, made trouble about this time and encouraged the Shanyue to join him.
Cao Caorejected this advice, however, and he besieged Zhang Xiu at Rang.
Without waiting for reinforcements, Gongsun Zan advanced deep into enemy territory; but then the tables were turned and he was besieged at Guanzi fortress in Liaoxi by Qiuliju and his army.18 Over two hundred days, with his army scattered and his supplies exhausted, five or six out of ten of his officers and men died.
Sun Jian said, "Your excellency, you are the leader of an imperial army and your authority makes the empire tremble. Why must you rely on Dong Zhuo?
I realise that the processes for these enfeoffments are already under way, and it is at this stage too late to reconsider them, but I really hope that your majesty will now call a halt.
Liu Qi was worried. He asked Zhuge Liang for advice as to how he might secure his position, but Zhuge Liang refused to answer.
Zuo Yuan of Chenliu was a student in the commandery school, but he violated the law and was expelled.
The leaders within the passes did have suspicions, and MaChao, Han Sui, Hou Xuan, Cheng Yin, Yang Qiu, Li Kan, ZhangHeng, Liang Xing, Cheng Yi, Ma Wan and their followers, tendivisions altogether, rose in rebellion. Their combined force was ahundred thousand men, and they set encampments to guard theTong Pass.
Sun Ce treated Zhang Chao as a teacher and a friend, and always took his advice in both civil and military affairs.
Lu Xun then arranged the eastern three commanderies into divisions and units,so that able-bodied men became soldiers and the weak were brought to fill vacancies in the registers of households. He obtained several ten thousand good soldiers,
Chong Shao and his fellow-conspirators were found out and fled to Huaili.
and Zhou Yu crossed the Yangzi and camped on the northern bank to oppose Cao Ren directly.
Qiu Xiang replied, "To act as an eagle or a hawk is not as good as being a phoenix. That is why I took no legal action against him."
When the former Inspector of Liang province, Zhu Liang, was first appointed to that territory, he presented impeachments of many offenders, administrators and magistrates. At least half of them were dismissed and the effect could be seen within a very short time. He should be honoured and rewarded, so that able men and good work may be encouraged.If we change the appointed governors and administrators,dismissing the wicked and corrupt men; and if we also choose new emissaries and protectors for the Xiongnu, the Wuhuan and the Qiang,selecting both civil and military appointments with care and providing them with them clear instructions; and if we relieve the tax requirements and corvée services of the current year for Bing and Liang provinces, showing leniency and forgiveness to those who have run foul of the law, to clear everything away and make a new beginning.
Altogether more than a hundred of the men of Faction died, and their wives and children were sent to exile on the frontiers.The eunuchs made accusation of Faction against all those of powerful family in the empire and all Confucian scholars who acted honourably. Anyone who had a grudge against another took the opportunity to inform against him, and the slightest irritation was enough to involve a charge of Faction.
"When your majesty first came to the throne, your first priority was to read through the classics. Only in the spare time from that occupation would you concern yourself with other writings, and they were no more than a past-time, an alternative to the Boyi game. They can never serve as the basis for education and selection to official position.
Yuan Shu is neither obedient to Heaven nor faithful tohis men. So when he looked for aid, where could he find it?"
In the fifth month Liu Biao sent soldiers to help Zhang Xiu.They camped at Anzhong and guarded the passes to block theretreat.
Gan Ning, Lil Meng and others fought strongly to hold the enemy off Ling Tong led Companions to help Sun Quan break out from the circle, then went back to fight Zhang Liao. All about him were killed and he himself was wounded. When he judged that Sun Quan must have escaped he made his way back.
In the spring, in the first month on the day dingyou [29 Feb], there was an amnesty for the empire.
In the eleventh month the Grand Commandant Cui Lie left office. The Minister of Finance Cao Song was made Grand Commandant.
Then Cao Cao settled Ji province, and Xing Yong of Hejian said to Tian Chou, "For more than twenty years, since the rebellion of the Yellow Turbans, the land within the four seas has been bubbling like a cauldron, and people have become homeless refugees.
Chen Gui therefore asked permission to retire to his home on account of age, but he was summoned once again to take position among the Masters of Writing [in the Imperial Secretariat].
As a result, groups of the Chendi Qiang of Shang commandery and the Xianlian Qiang of Anding made combined attacks on Wuwei and Zhangye. All Chinese positions along the border were seriously affected.
'That is not the way. It is like keeping an eagle: if he is hungry he can be used, but when he is well fed he will fly away.'
Du Xi, Zhao Yan and Po Qin, men of Yingchuan, had taken refugefrom the troubles and come to Jing province. Liu Biao treated allthree as his guests.
Zhai Rong, however, took the grain for his own purposes. He raised a great Buddhist hall of worship, encouraged people to read the Buddhist sutras, and brought in those of nearby commanderies who loved the Buddha, more than five thousand households.
Yuan Shao could not appreciate such great matters, and he only ran away because he was frightened.
More than ten thousand officials and commoners died, the bodies scattered in the streets.
With her two elder brothers, she quietly made plans to prepare a hiding place for Li Xie.They spread it abroad that he had returned to the capital, and everyone believed the story.
"Again, matters of selection and promotion should be in the hands of those who are formally entrusted with that responsibility, and all private approaches for appointment in the government should be strictly forbidden.
Mi Fang held the city [of Jiangling, capital of Nan commandery], but when Lü Meng showed Shi Ren to him, Mi Fang too opened his gates and surrendered.
replied Sun Ce, "as a gentleman of family you have numbers of men under your command, and you have already made a reputation for yourself on campaign. Why should you accept such a low appointment and to attend the petty details of my army?"
He kept his followers at a distance, there was no-one he would trust, and his best councillors and commanders gradually drifted away.
Many of the people, however, loved their homeland and refused to leave, so Xun Yu alone led his family and clan away to join Han Fu.
21 February 163 - 10 February 164
The Grand Commandant Liu Ju left office.The Minister of Ceremonies Yang Bing became Grand Commandant.
In the north Jing province holds the Han and the Mian, and it gains vast profit from the southern sea. East it joins with Wu and Kuaiji, west it reaches to Ba and Shu.30 Here is a country which is valuable in war, yet its master cannot hold it. It is almost as if Heaven is giving it to you.
each carrying letters to tell the newsto the commander of the garrison at Hefei. One group got into thecity, but the other two were captured by Sun Quan.
As a result, he had enemies both inside and outside the court, and they joined to accuse him of bribing the Qiang in order to bring about a false surrender.The emperor sent a series of letters under seal to reprimand him.
In the eighth month there were great rains, the Han River broke its banks and the whole plain was covered by water scores of feet deep.
If rewardsprovide no incentive, it is called 'restraining the good'; if punish ments have no effect, it is called 'setting loose evil'.
An edict ordered the Three Excellencies and the Director of Retainers to arrest and question all the attendants and guards of the palace and the common people of the capital district who were followers of Zhang Jue's teaching. More than a thousand people were executed.Orders were sent to Ji province that Zhang Jue and his followers should be arrested.
The School at the Gate of the Vast Capital was established. It was ordered that provincial and commandery administrations, and the Three Excellencies, should nominate students. Some [of those who graduated] went out as Inspectors or Administrators, others were appointed in the central government as Masters of Writing or Palace Attendants. Several of them were enfeoffed as marquises or given lesser orders of noble rank. All true scholars and gentlemen felt ashamed to be classed with such fellows.
Futai the King of Fuyu raided Xuantu. The Administrator of Xuantu,Gongsun Yu, attacked and defeated him.
"What would your idea be?" asked Cao Cao.
Yuan Shang's officers Lü Kuang and Gao Xiang rebelled andturned to Cao Cao, but then Yuan Tan had generals' seals [323]carved in secret and sent to them.
Cao Cao said to Jia Xu, "ChengYu is braver than Meng Ben or Xia Yu."
Moreover, the people of our clan have been slaughtered. Do not recall [the example of] Wu Zixu? How can you still accept this ruler?
For these reasons, serving the majesty of Great Han, I have set up a plan for the long term. I intend to cut the problem out by the roots, so it will never grow again.
Bing Yuan travelled far in search of learning, and after eight or nine years he was due to go home. Because he did not drink wine, his teachers and school fellows prepared only rice and meat for the farewell party.Bing Yuan said, "I used to drink wine, but I stopped because it confused my thoughts and prevented me from working.

The prison officer said to him, "The heavenly grace has been extended, but you do not leave. Why not?"
The General of Agile Cavalry Dong Zhong disputed He Jin's authority, and the eunuchs enlisted his aid in support of their party.
Shen Pei looked at him and said: "Dog, it is only because ofpeople like you that my Ji province has been destroyed. I regret thatI could not kill you,
Liu Bei returned to Gongan.Many years later he learnt about this, and he sighed and said,"Anywhere in the empire, wise men think alike. Kongming [ZhugeLiang] warned me not to go, and he too was concerned over whatmight happen.
As many cities of Ji province rebelled to support Gongsun Zan,
So Zhang Liao returned to the fight, charged the ring and brought out the rest of his company.All Sun Quan's men and horses were scattered and none dared face Zhang Liao.
This letter is to remind us that if we attack them before they have surrounded the city, we shall reduce their early strength and raise the morale of our own troops. Then we can hold out."
By the time he came to Dangyang Liu Bei's followers numbered more than a hundred thousand, the baggage was in several thousand carts, and he could travel only about ten li in a day.
Yang Qiu took personal charge of the examination, and Wang Fu and the others suffered the full extent of the five torments.Wang Meng had at one time in the past been Director of Retainers, and he said to Yang Qiu, "Father and son, we are [156] both liable to execution. But there is still the principle of seniority. You may spare my father some of the pain."
Zhao Wei protested several times, but hisadvice was not heeded, and he too became angry and resentful.
In this year Hede, younger uncle of the King of Shule, killed the king and took the throne for himself.
By the time Li Jue and the others came back [from their raid into Yingchuan and Chenliu] Niu Fu was dead. Li Jue and the others had nowhere to go, so they sent a messenger to Chang'an asking for pardon.
Cai Yong begged his excuses: "Unworthy though I am, there are great principles which are constant from ancient times to the present, and I have heard and recited them too often to forget them. How could I work for Dong Zhuo and neglect my duty to the state?
Rebels of Cangwu and Guiyang attacked the commandery and county offices. The Administrator of Lingling, Yang Xuan, prepared several dozen horse-drawn carriages, loaded them with baskets of quicklime, and tied strips of cloth to the horses' tails. He also constructed war chariots, with archers and crossbow-men.
He destroyed both of them.
All wept and said, "We would give our lives for it."
Cao Cao said, "When we raised loyal troops, all the people supported us, and they did so because our cause is just.
When Fa Zheng arrived in Jing province he put his plan to Liu Beiin a private conversation: "With your courage and skill you can takeadvantage of Governor Liu's lack of energy. Zhang Song is legs andarms to that province, and he will be like an echo to you within thecourt. You can take Yi province as easily as you turn your hand."
Lu Bu had outposts west of Puyang. Cao Cao attacked them by night and destroyed them.
Before this, when the Dowager was established [as Empress in 165], Chen Fan had played a considerable role,
At this time, the emperor was by the Pond of the Shining Dragon [in the pleasure ground near the Northern Palace].Guan Ba came to report on the question of Li Yun and his supporters.He knelt down and said, "Li Yun is a silly scholar from the country-side, and Du Zhong is a petty official in a commandery. They just got excited and carried away. They're not worth punishing."
So the Han has a number of different ways of obtaining men to serve.
When Liu Bei entered Chengdu he held a banquet for his troops.
Someone said to Liu Bei, "Zhao Yun has fled to the north."
Next day, he saw Sun Shao andappointed him Colonel Who Upholds Courage with command of allhis father's troops.
It is difficult to express one's full opinion on the futility and dishonesty of this dirty mess.
Wang Lang of Donghai, Headquarters Officer in Xu province, and the Attendant Officer Zhao Yu of Langye suggested to their Inspector Tao Qian, "If you wish to be numbered amongst the feudal lords, the best method is to show loyalty to the throne.Now that the Son of Heaven is away in the western capital you should send a messenger to take tribute.
Even so, I still have hope. Can you tell if I may ever be successful?"
Li Jue and Guo Si fought one another for months on end, and the dead were numbered in the tens of thousands.
ou, my general, must act at once to remove evil from the empire, and leave a name for later generations. You cannot let this opportunity slip."
Then Lü Bu ordered a captain to set up a halberd at the gate ofthe camp. He bent his bow, looked around and said, "You will allsee me shoot at the small spike on that halberd. If I hit it, both sidesdraw back your men. If I miss, then you can stay to settle your quarrel."
He cut off the head of Yuan Shao's messenger and sent the sealand ribbon which he had been offered to Cao Cao.
"Had King Cheng killed the Duke of Shao," responded KongRong, "could the Duke of Zhou claim not to have known?"
About this time Sun Quan came to Jiangling, and the military and civil officers of Jing province came to attend him. Only the Headquarters Officer Pan Jun of Wuling claimed to be sick and refused to come to audience.
Before this, Zhang Wen had raised three thousand shock cavalry from among the Wuhuan of You province to use them in Liang province. The former Chancellor of Zhongshan, Zhang Chun of Yuyang, asked to be given the command, but Zhang Wen turned him down and appointed the magistrate of Zhuo, Gongsun Zan of Liaoxi.
Yuan Shang fled by night and took refuge in the Qi Hills.
Lord Cao supports the emperor and punishes cruelty andrebellion. His laws are clear and his government is ordered. Highand low follow his commands. You could say that he follows thetrue Way. "The Yuan, on the other hand, relying on their strength, turntheir backs to the royal commands and urge on barbarians tooppress China. One may well say that they oppose virtue.
On the day bingshen [28 Feb], last of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.
When this report was sent in [from the office of the Masters of Writing, the Imperial Secretariat], the Regular Attendant Lu Qiang of Henan, concerned that Cai Yong was innocent, offered a strongly- worded appeal on his behalf.
but in the sixth month the Administrator of Nanyang, Qin Jie, attacked him and killed him.
In the ninth month the Grand Commandant Zhang Hao left office. The Minister of Ceremonies Chen Qiu became Grand Commandant.
Cao Zhi had married a daughter of Cui Yan's elder brother.
You may be master on the inside, and I shall be your ally abroad. I have suppliesand you have troops, we complement each other. Live or die, let usact together."
Though his army was defeated at the Chang Slope, said Zhuge Liang, "the troops that have returned to him, added to the fleet commanded by Guan Yu, amount to ten thousand men, all armed and trained. And Liu Qi has joined him with fighting men from Jiangxia, again no fewer than ten thousand men.
Xin Pi told his daughter Xianying, and she sighed, "The Heir isthe one who must take the place of the lord and master at the ceremonies in the ancestral temple and at the sacrifices on the national altars to the gods of soil and grain.
Wang Fu's adopted son Wang Ji was Chancellor of Pei, and was particularly oppressive and tyrannical. Whenever he had a man killed, he would place the corpse on a cart, accompanied by a placard listing the person's crimes, and have it taken to each of the counties under his jurisdiction. In summer months the flesh would rot away, but he still tied the bones together and sent them around till they had travelled through the whole commandery. Everyone who saw them was terrified.
Dong Zhuo now sent the General of the Household of the East Dong Yue to camp at Mianchi, the General of the Household Duan Wei to camp at Huayin, and the General of the Household Niu Fu to camp at Anyi. His other commanders were spread out among the counties to block any attack from the east of the mountains.
And now, when you are constantly concerned that he may kill you, how can you talk of father and son?
In the twelfth month the Excellency over the Masses Chunyu Jia left office. The Minister of the Guards Zhao Wen became Excellency over the Masses with control of the Secretariat.
When Dong Zhuo's soldiers observed such discipline, they turned back without venturing an attack.
"If what they say is true," replied He Xia, "then Mao Jie's fault is indeed serious, an offence to the sight of Heaven and Earth.
You can get copper from the hills and salt from thesea.19 There is wealth and abundance within your borders and yoursubjects have no thought of rebellion. What is there to threaten you?Why send hostages?
When he threw the axe at you, where was the feeling of father and son?"
"There are ten points where Yuan Shao is weak and you are hissuperior, so though Yuan Shao may be powerful he will never gainsuccess:
The best plan is go south against Jing province and wait forsomething to happen. When things have changed, we can attackthem, and the whole affair may be settled in a single blow." "Excellent!" said Cao Cao, and in the fifth month, leaving hiscommander Jia Xin in camp at Liyang, he returned to Xu city. [318]
Yuan Shao hadlaid an ambush to surprise him, and Gongsun Zan was heavilydefeated.
Yuan Shao sent his officer Yan Liang to attack Liu Yan the Admini strator of Dong commandery at Boma. Ju Shou said, "Yan Liangis careless and impatient He is brave, but he cannot manage alone."
And brave men are rising everywhere, each with a province or a commandery. They gather followers and collect their forces, and whenever they move they can number their troops by the tens of thousands. This is the time that the Qin have lost a deer, and the first to catch it will rule as king.
When Liu Bei settled SHU, he divided Guanghan to form Zi- tong commandery, and appointed Huo Jun as Administrator.
In such a case, customs will have neither faultnor perversity, and the people will have no inclination to evil. Thisis what is meant by 'keeping customs well'.
Liu Yan was made Governor of Yi province, the Minister Coachman Huang Wan became Governor of Yu province, and the Minister of the Imperial House Liu Yu of Donghai became Governor of You province.
Liu Biao's territory now extended over several thousand li, andhe had more than a hundred thousand men at arms. He no longersent up tribute, he held state sacrifice and worship to Heaven andEarth and in his lodging and clothing he usurped the regalia of anemperor.
"On the other hand, should anyone suggest that I give up my[413] army, hand over my power, and retire to my fief at Wuping,then that just cannot be.
The Colonel of Elite Cavalry Dou Wu became Colonel of the City Gates.
Lu Zhi of Zhuo commandery sent a letter to Dou Wu: "Your relationship to the court of Han is like that of Dan [the Duke of Zhou] and Shi [the Duke of Shao] to the house of Zhou.You have set a sage ruler upon the throne, and now all the world has a centre to rely upon. Those who consider the matter regard this as your most significant achievement so far.
Zhang Huan declined, but asked instead for permission to transfer his official domicile to Hongnong.
Sun Quan brought Zhou Yu to discuss the matter with hismother the Lady Wu. Zhou Yu said, "In ancient times, when Chuwas first established as a vassal state [of the Zhou dynasty], it hadnot so much as a hundred li of territory.
Lu Zhi was eight feet two inches tall,with a deep voice like a bell. By nature he was stern and upright, with a strong sense of morality.
If I make myself the opposite of Cao Cao in everything, [431] then the affairmay be successful.
"Besides this, east of the mountains there has long been peace and the people have no experience of war. West of the passes they have lately suffered the ravages of the Qiang barbarians, and even women and girls can carry a bow and fight. The men of Bing and Liang, and the non-Chinese auxiliaries, are feared throughout the empire, and they are your teeth and claws. It will be like sending tigers and rhinoceros against dogs and sheep, or calling up a violent wind to sweep away dead leaves. Who will dare oppose them?
When they came to battle, he placed the horse-drawn carriages at the front, and the lime was thrown up with a favouring wind. The enemy could not see.Then he set fire to the cloth [which had been tied to the horses' tails]. The horses were terrified, and fled into the midst of the enemy ranks.Then he had the war-chariots brought from the rear, bows and crossbows firing at random, while the sound of gongs and drums shook the air.Overwhelmed as if by waves, the enemy force was smashed and scattered; uncounted numbers were killed or wounded in the pursuit which followed. They took the heads of the leaders, and the whole commandery territory was now at peace.
You will have taken the offensive but gained no success, and whenyou seek to retreat you will have no place to turn.
Qiuliju and his allies were glad to hear that he had come. Each sent messengers and then they all went back home.
Then Cao Cao sent Liu Bei with Zhu Ling to intercept YuanShu.60 Cheng Yu, Guo Jia and Dong Zhao all objected, "You can'tsend Liu Bei."
He did not dismiss Shen Pei. After this, Shen Pei became friends with Pang Ji.
The army then turned against Huaili, and Chong Shao and the others were all killed.
The Shibao prophecies are superstitious, apocryphal works. How can one trust them?"
So He Jin made Yuan Shao Director of Retainers, with the Staff of Authority to decide and execute cases on his own,and he appointed his Gentleman in Attendance Wang Yun as Intendant of Henan.
Cao Cao took Zhang Xiu by thehand, gave a banquet, arranged for his son Cao Jun to marry ZhangXiu's daughter,
Yuan Shao's troops maintained their pursuit to Jie Bridge. Gongsun Zan regrouped his men to turn and fight, but Qu Yi again defeated him. They came to Gongsun Zan's camp and seized his standard,and the rest of his army took to flight.
Yang Xiu told King Cao of WEI about this, but Cao Cao delayed before looking into the accusation.
At the time of Dong Zhuo's death, the population of the capital district was still numbered by the hundreds of thousands of households. But Li Jue and his armies plundered far and [149] wide, then there was famine, and within two years the people had been reduced to cannibalism. All but a very few left the territory or died of starvation.
My position was extremely difficult, and I had tomake the journey, but it was certainly dangerous, and I almost fellinto the clutches of Zhou Yu."
"If you move against Ye, for his own preservation Yuan Shangmust go back to guard his base.
Though the Yellow Turbans are numerous they are no cause for anxiety to your court.
Duan Jiong pursued them, and kept up a running fight day and night.He rationed the food, and his men took snow to drink, and after more than forty days they came to Jishi Mountain, two thousand li beyond the frontier.They took the heads of the great chiefs of the Shaohe tribe and compelled the rest of them to surrender.Then they returned.
"You just don’t understand things," answered Sun Jian.
"The best thing is to go to Lord Cao," replied Jia Xu
In the fifth month the Grand Commandant Wenren Xi and the Excellency of Works Xu Xu left office.In the sixth month, the Excellency over the Masses Liu Chong became Grand Commandant, the Minister of Ceremonies Xu Xun became Excellency over the Masses, and the Minister Coachman Liu Ao of Changsha became Excellency of Works.
Lü Bu saw Cao Cao and said, "This is the day that the empire issettled."
The Registrar Huang Quan of Baxi objected, "Liu the Generalof the Left has a great reputation for bravery, [430] and you are inviting him here. You will never satisfy his ambition if you treathim as a subordinate, but if you behave towards him as your guestand equal, it will be difficult for a single state to hold two lords. T
Fu Xie's son Fu Gan, thirteen years old, said to his father, "The nation is in confusion and disorder, and that is why you have never received your true deserts from the court.
Ma Chao and his fellows attacked the camp indarkness, but soldiers from ambush caught them by surprise anddefeated them.
In the spring, in the first month on the day xinyou [14 Feb], there was a fire in the Hall of Excellent Virtue in the Southern Palace.On the day wuzi [13 Mar] there was a fire in the C-Office.
Now, however, Heaven is displaying strange signs, earth spits forth uncanny creations, and mankind has pestilence and disease. With these three situations all together, even if we still have the Yellow River running clear,
Yuan Shu sent Han Yin as envoy to Lü Bu, explaining his imperialclaim and asking for the marriage alliance. Lü Bu agreed to send hisdaughter back with him.
When the tablets were first erected, the carriages of those who came to see them and to take rubbings of them were numbered by the thousands every day, filling and blocking the roads.
Cao Cao wanted tobreak off for a time, but the Consultant Cao Chun said, "Our army isisolated, we are a long way into enemy territory, and it will not beeasy to hold this position for long. Now that we have gone forward,however, if we go back without victory we shall certainly loseface."
Whilehalf of his force had still to cross Zhong Yao attacked andcompletely defeated him.
He Jin learnt privately of the plot, and he sent in a memorial that Yuan Shao should be sent to collect the soldiers of the two provinces of Xu and Yan. This was a means to delay, because Yuan Shao had to return before he himself went to the west.
Liu Bei travelled north from Jiangzhou along the Dianjiang River toFu.
"And yet some petty fellows have put forward arguments to confuse your sage understanding, causing you to raise your majestic wrath, equal to that of Heaven, against these two men. Surely the punishment they have received is already excessive.
The Empress Liang [Nüying] placed great store upon the support she received from her elder brother [Liang Ji] and her elder sister [Liang Na, the Empress of Emperor Shun, now Empress-Dowager].She was quite unrestrained in her conduct and very extravagant, more so than any of her predecessors.She was also exceedingly jealous, so that [at first] none of the women of the palace could gain access to the emperor.
He had quarrelled with Yuan Shao, and each established a faction against the other:
Before this, when the imperial edict was issued calling for reports of those involved in faction, some of the commanderies and kingdoms submitted more than a hundred names. The Chancellor of Pingyuan, Shi Bi, was the only one who sent none.
Their deceit and falsity should be made clear, and they should be sent back to their native villages."
The people of Anping and Ganling seized their kings and madecause with the rebels.
Since Lord Cao's army had only justbegun its withdrawal, he was sure to command the rear-guard. Thatis why I knew you would be defeated.
Look at the way he speaks: he does not even pretend to courtesy towards you. He treats his superiors lightly and has no sense of respect. This [198] is one crime. Bian Zhang and Han Sui have defied the law for more than a year and now is the time to advance and punish the rebels, yet Dong Zhuo says we cannot go. He delays the army and makes the people uncertain. This is a second crime. Dong Zhuo holds an official position but has nothing to show for it, he waited a long time before he answered your summons, he acts with disrespect and holds himself high. This is the third crime.
Dong Zhuo also appointed the Master of Writing Han Fu as Governor of Ji province, the Palace Attendant Liu Dai as Inspector of Yen, and Kong Zhou of Chenliu as Inspector of Yu. Zhang Miao of Dongping became Administrator of Chenliu, and Zhang Zi of Yingchuan was Administrator of Nanyang.
For fear of Cao Cao, Yuan Shu's cousin Yuan Yin dared notremain at Shouchun. With Yuan Shu's coffin and his wife and child ren, he fled with his followers to Liu Xun, Administrator of Lujiang,at Huan city.
Gongsun Zan took the authority to give appointments to his officers: Yan Gang as Inspector of Ji province, Tian Kai as Inspector of Qing province, and Shan Jing as Inspector of Yan province.
In the twelfth month Cao Cao came back from Anding. He leftXiahou Yuan in camp at Chang'an
On the day guimao [20 Sep] the General Who Gives Tranquillity to the State Zhang Yang was made Grand Marshal, Yang Feng became General of Chariots and Cavalry and Han Xian was named General-in-Chief with authority as Director of Retainers. All held the Staff of Authority and Battleaxes.
On the day guisi [4 Jun] there was a great wind, rain and hail, and thunderbolts. More than a hundred large trees were uprooted.
Liu Pu and his colleagues were demoted to secondary marquisates. Yin Xun and the others also lost their ranks of nobility.
He became afraid and fled into hiding, but Liang Ji caught him and killed him.
But I must act on behalf of the court, and keep hold of talented men. How can I fall for this scheme?" He took no action.
I and my family have received favour from the state for generations.I think little of my own person, but I regard the position which I hold as very important.Facing death, I present these comments, albeit they are less than respectful.
Just then Liu Bei was eating, and he dropped his spoon andchopsticks [in his flurry]. At that moment there was thunder in thesky, and Liu Bei said, "The sage has it, 'On a sudden clap ofthunder, or a violent wind, he would change composure.' Very muchlike me."
You wish to do away with the son of the legal wife and set the son of a concubine in his place, but I fear the people will not accept your argument."
Liu Zhang agreed,and he sent Fa Zheng with four thousand men to invite Liu Bei.
Cao Cao attacked Yuan Shu's army, defeated it, then besieged Fengqiu.
while when the junior officers and people in Jiangheard Jia Kui might be killed they climbed on the city walls andshouted, "If Guo Yuan turns back on the agreement and kills ourworthy leader, it would be better for all of us to die."
Cao Cao appointed his son Cao Zhang, Marquis of Yanling, as Acting General of Resolute Cavalry and sent him to attack them.
"In earlier times," responded Xun Yu, "when Duke Wen of Jinreceived King Xiang of the Zhou, all the feudal lords admired himand followed him. 20 Gaozu of Han wore mourning for theProvisional Emperor and the people of the empire turned theirhearts to him.
Indeed, the governors and administrators are not good men.Some of them have been appointed through recommendations of the eunuchs, they are afraid to disobey the instructions they receive from above, and they follow them quite thoughtlessly.
Tao Qian the Governor of Xu province was seriously ill. He said to his Attendant Officer Mi Zhu of Donghai, "No-one but Liu Bei can ever give peace to this province."
A time came that Li Jue sent a gift of some food, and Guo Si's wife made salted beans into a poisonous drug, then picked them out as if they had come with the present. Showing them to her husband, she said, "Two cocks cannot roost on the same branch. I do not believe you should be so trusting of Lord Li."
"It is my firm opinion, however, that Lord Cao will achieve hisdesign for the empire.
At this time there were still thirty thousand trained soldiers within the city, and sufficient grain and cloth to last a year. All his followers were prepared for a fight to the death,
The best thing to do is move west together, attack Chang'an and avenge Lord Dong.
Now check the real situation. The troops he brought with him from central China were no more than a hundred and fifty or a hundred and sixty thousand, and they have been on hard active service for a long time. Then he got men from Liu Biao, seventy or eighty thousand at most, and their loyalty is still suspect.
If you take infantry and cavalry and make campoutside, I shall take command of the rest of the army and hold fastinside the city.
Sun the General Who Exterminates Caitiffs, replied Lu Su, "is wise and generous. He respects worthy men and treats scholars with courtesy. All the leaders of the lands beyond the Yangzi have joined him, and he now controls six commanderies. His soldiers are well-trained, he has quantities of supplies, and he is strong enough to maintain his independence.
In this [eighth] month the White Planet [Venus] encroached upon the Commanding General star of the House constellation and then entered the Supreme Subtlety Enclosure.
Dou Wu and Dou Shao fled, and the whole army chased them and surrounded them. They both committed suicide, and their heads were displayed at the Capital Watch-House of Luoyang. Dou Wu's kinsmen, clients and relatives by marriage were arrested and executed, while the Palace Attendant Liu Yu and the Colonel of the Garrison Cavalry Feng Shu were also killed, with all their clans.
"You may have my head," replied Huo Jun, "but you cannot have the city."
Du Xi gave peace and encouragement, and over eighty thousand of the people were glad to migrate to Luoyang and Ye.
Fu Xie the Administrator of Hanyang said to Geng Bi, "Commissioner, you do not have great experience in administration, and the people are not yet accustomed to you.
"Yang Feng has no friends at court," answered Dong Zhao,"and he is your ally.
Guo Tai saw this and asked him about it.Meng Min replied, "The pot is broken. What is the point of looking at it?"Considering this showed true discernment, Guo Tai engaged him in further conversation. He recognised his virtuous qualities, and urged him to travel [to Luoyang] to study. As a result, Meng Min made his name known among all the people of that time.
Cui Qi of Zhuo commandery was greatly admired by Liang Ji for his ability as a writer, but when Cui Qi composed his "Admonitions to the Consort Clan" and "Rhapsody on the White Crane", which criticised and satirised him, Liang Ji became angry.
I fear that whenthings are decided there will be accusations made and punishmentscarried out, and you will be one of the first to be executed!"
Cao Cao arrested Zhi Xi and was going to kill him, but then pardoned him.
Li Jue and his men arrested the Director of Retainers Huang Wan
Whenever the Dowager Dong sought to interfere in matters of government the Dowager He always stopped her. The Lady Dong was furious and shouted, "You are powerful now because you rely on your brother! But I can order the General of Agile Cavalry to cut off He Jin's head, and that would be easy as turning my hand!"
I shall deal first with Yuan Shao, then send troops against Liu Dai."
Dong Zhuo said to his Chief Clerk Liu Ai, "The armies east of the passes have often been defeated. All of them are afraid of me and can do nothing effective.
And you are the chief officer of the state, yet you have established an alliance with such a gang! How can you side with those rebels?"
The Shanyue hills people of Danyang commandery besieged the Administrator Chen Yin. Chen Yin attacked and defeated them.
"Be quiet," ordered Sun Ce. "I have thought it outit carefully.
A Division was the equivalent of an army under a general. A Large Division had more than ten thousand men, a Small Division had six or seven thousand men, and each had leaders appointed.
Now that Yang Qiu had executed Wang Fu, he wanted to proceed further with a memorial against Cao Jie and his party. So he gave instructions to his Assistant Officer for Officials at the Capital, "My first priority is the chief rascals among the powerful and the honoured [the eunuchs and others within the palace], then I shall consider the rest.
In the ninth month on the day dingwei [6 Nov] there was an earthquake in the capital district.
"Furthermore, if you delay matters, there will be changes. The example of Yin is not far off. You must make your mind up soon."
Next day they sent in baskets of silk. Yang Xiu reported it again, the baskets were examined, and there was no-one inside. Cao Cao became suspicious of Yang Xiu.
Tian Chou told him, "This road is always flooded in autumn and summer. Too deep for carts or horses but too shallow for boats, it has long been a problem.
Yang Ci replied, "The Apocrypha of the Spring and Autumn Annals say: 'When Heaven sends a rainbow, all the world is angry and all within the seas is in confusion.'
Tanshihuai died and his son Helian succeeded him.
but Chang Lin the Officer of Merit said, "Theofficers and people of the north love peace and are weary ofdisorder. They have long accepted our government, and the majorityof them are loyal.
Ju Yuan had guards arrest Zhang Yun on the charge that he had entered the palace without proper authorisation and was planning some act of rebellion.
There was a popular song in the streets and alley-ways:Father Jia came too late,Or we would never have made rebellion.Now all is peace and content,And officials dare not feed at our expense.
So Yuan Tan brought his forces to attack Yuan Shang,and they fought outside the gates [of the city of Ye].
I am a former officer of the Yuan, answered Han Fu," and my ability is not equal to that of Benchu [Yuan Shao].I have taken account of his virtue, and so I cede it to him. The men of ancient times saw honour in such conduct.35 Why do you alone find fault?"
Yuan Shao agreed, he wrote promptly to Gongsun Zan,
As Yuan Shao's army came south from the Yan Crossing, Cao Caohad his soldiers in camp under the southern slope.
In the autumn, Cao Cao led his men to attack Tao Qian. Hestormed more than ten cities, and came to Pengcheng, where there was a great battle. Tao Qian's army was defeated and he fled to take refuge in Tan.
Zhang He was camped at Guangshi, and Liu Bei attacked him without success.
Then Huangfu Gui was made General on the Liao, and after a few months in that station he sent in a memorial recommending Zhang Huan: "His ability and strategic sense are both of the highest order, and he is worthy of the highest command. Everyoneis waiting for such a man.
Lü Bu and his followers climbed the White Gate Tower and the enemysoldiers were close around them. Lü Bu told his attendants to cut offhis head and send it to Cao Cao. They could not bear to do it, so hewent down and surrendered.
Now the court is wandering and in flight, and the imperial ancestral temples are destroyed. Look at the provinces and commanderies: their rulers pretend to maintain troops for the emperor, but in secret each is planning against the other. There is no concern for the national altars and no thought of giving rest to the people.
Liu Tao, Senior Clerk under the Excellency over the Masses, then sent in another memorial.Repeating Yang Ci's suggestions, he added that, "Zhang Jue's secret plans are increasingly threatening. The empire is full of whispers and rumours, and it is claimed that Zhang Jue and his followers have gained entry to the capital and have spies within the court.
Zhao Zhong, Xia Yun and others made false accusatios against Lu Qiang, saying that he had discussed affairs of state with the men of Faction, that he had read and re-read the biography of Huo Guang,
When Tao Qian arrived he attacked the Yellow Turbans, completely defeated them and put them to flight.The territory of the province was at peace.
Supuyan of Liaodong, with a following of about a thousand groups, styled himself the Severe King,
Zhao Wei besieged Liu Zhang in Chengdu.
The enemy were in great numbers, and Duan Jiong's men were frightened.
There were great rains day and night for twenty days and more, and the floods destroyed people's houses.
So Lü Meng entered Jiangling. Releasing Yu Jin, he captured the families and dependants of Guan Yu and his men. He comforted and looked after them, giving orders to his army that there should be "No plundering of private houses."
You hold the imperial authority, and all essential military strength. With the leap of a dragon and the pace of a tiger, you may act as you will."The present plan, however, is like pumping up fire in a stove when all that is needed is to singe a hair.
Ju Jun cursed him and said, "You and your fellows have made brutal rebellion. You oppress the emperor, you have brought harm to the highest ministers, and the palace women are scattered abroad.
From the excellencies, ministers and counsellors down to civil appointments in the commanderies and counties, officials were chosen for their understanding of the classics and for the quality of their bearing. All the guards Rapid as Tigers were learned in the Classic of Filial Piety, and the sons and younger brothers of the Xiongnu barbarians came to the Imperial University for education.So Teaching was established above and Custom perfected below.
Then Han Fu and his associates asked Liu Yu to take control of the Imperial Secretariat, with authority to grant enfeoffments and make appointments. Still he would not hear of it, threatening to take refuge amongst the Xiongnu as a means to cut himself off from such proposals. So Yuan Shao and the others gave up the idea.
and the eunuchs now held a deadly hatred for Chen Fan. Many of his recommendations for office and his memorials were turned down or rejected.
and Jianwei, while Zhang Fei took Baxi and Deyang,
"In this [Ji] province, the borders are comparatively peaceful,you have a strong army, and the gentry support you. Go west to welcome the imperial carriage, and set the palace at Ye city. If you hold the emperor you will have authority over the other lords, and you can collect men and horses to punish those that will not pay court. Who could dare to oppose it?"
while Zheng Tai fled to Yuan Shu.Xun You spoke and ate and drank as usual. Soon afterwards Dong Zhuo died and he was released.
Fa Zheng of [You]fufeng was Colonel Consultant of the Army toLiu Zhang, but Liu Zhang paid no attention to anything hesuggested, and he was despised by the people of his district who hadcome to take refuge with him in Shu. Fa Zheng was discouragedthat he could not realise his ambitions.
And are you equal to Liu Bei?
On the day jiayin [7 Jun] the Marquis of Canhu Village, Liu Bo, who was the son of the [late] Filial King of Hejian [Liu Gong/Kai], was enfeoffed as King of Rencheng in order that he might maintain thesuccession of the Filial King [of Rencheng, Liu Shang].
Later he encouraged me to cede territory to Xuande [Liu Bei], but this was his only weakness, and not enough to discount his two fine actions.
Cao Cao called for men to break the enemy line, and the Major Dian Wei of Chenliu led out a group of volunteers. Lu Bu's archers and crossbowmen fired at them from every direction, and the arrows and bolts came down like rain.
In the eleventh month Cao Cao came to the Yi River. The Wuhuan Shanyu Pufulu of Dai commandery and Nalou [i.e. Nanlou] of Shang[gu] came to offer congratulations.
The same night that Xiahou Dun arrived, however, he executed several dozen men who had planned rebellion, and the army was settled.
but Liu Yao replied, "If I appointed Ziyi [Taishi Ci], Xu Zijiang [Xu Shao] would laugh at me."
Chen Fan sent in a memorial, saying, "It has been the principle that feudal lords should match the territories in the heavens which number four times seven, and they should be a screen to protect the ruler.It was Emperor Gao's promise that no man should be made a marquis unless he had performed some worthy service
Dong Cheng sent the Prefect of Insignia and Credentials Sun Hui to cut him down in the midst of the crowd. He killed one of the attendants and blood splashed on the Empress' clothes.
"War has its changes," replied Jia Xu. "Follow him quickly."
The emperor is young and weak, and I am the only person he can depend upon. Even when danger comes, I cannot run away.
He faced Zhang Rang and his fellows with an angry shout, "If you do not die quickly, I shall kill you."
As a result, those who know about it laugh, while the empire as a whole is sad and grieved.
Now we have a young ruler who is feeble and weak, in the power of an evil minister. These are not the faults for which [the King of] Changyi [Liu He] forfeited his imperial throne.2If we make a sudden change, who in the empire can be at ease?
Han Fu received one of the letters and asked the members of his staff, "Do we support the Yuan clan or the Dong?"
Guo Si heard about this, and said, "For the time being, let him go to a county near here."
Sun Quan was in the utmost grief and pain, and three hundred families were set to maintain Lü Meng's tomb.
Yuan Shao and his uncle Yuan Wei forged imperial orders summoning Fan Ling and Xu Xiang, and had them beheaded.
Next day Liu Bei wanted to attack across the Han.The officers [of WEI] believed their army was too weak to match the enemy, and they wanted to form ranks to guard the bank against him.
His true favourites were merchants and common fellows, whom he treated like brothers and accepted as relatives by marriage. Such men behaved as bullies, and the people hated them.
Shen Peifought them in the streets, but Cao Cao's men captured him alive.
For penetrating intelligence and fine erudition, we seldom see his like in China."
"You are facing him alone with an isolated army," observed XuYou. "There can be no help from outside and your supplies arealready exhausted. This is a critical situation.
