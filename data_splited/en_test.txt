Taishi Ci thereforebrought his forces forward to Jing, and he was joined by greatnumbers of the Shanyue.
In the autumn, in the seventh month, Duan Jiong sent a thousand men to Xi county to construct a barrier of trees against them, twenty feet across and forty li long.
From this we may observe: how can Teaching be neglected? how may Custom be despised?
Sun Quan called his ministers into conference. ZhangZhao, Qin Song and others were uncertain and could not decide.
About this time the Commandant of Cavalry, Cao Cao of Pei kingdom, arrived with reinforcements, and in the fifth month Huangfu Song, Cao Cao, and Zhu Jun combined their armies and returned to the attack. They completely defeated the rebels and cut off heads by the tens of thousands.
On the day gengzi [17 Feb] the emperor took his position. The reign title was changed [from Yongkang to Jianning].
The General of the Household for All Purposes Cao Pi was left tohold Ye city, with the General Who Displays Firmness Cheng Yu asAdviser to his Army. The Commander at the Gate Xu Xuan ofGuangling became Protector of the Army of the Left in charge ofmilitary affairs, while Guo Yuan of Le'an, Chief Clerk in Residence,dealt with civilian matters.
"I have heard of setting out pictures in order to demonstrate encouragement or warning, or to serve as a model of good and ill for the ruler. But I have never before heard that when mean and petty fellows compose a few false words of praise, they can then presume to such absurdly high office, and even have their portraits put on display.
The dowager took his majesty as her own son; how can his majesty fail to accept her as his mother?
On the other hand, Yuan is an old friend and a sworn ally. Here is the right plan for this moment: cede Ji province to Yuan. He will certainly be grateful to you, and Gongsun Zan cannot contest him.
Do you think you're more valuable than Zhuang Jia?" Xin Zeng and the others were frightened, and they followed him.
In the winter, in the tenth month, Cao Cao moved east to attack SunQuan.
In the autumn, in the seventh month on the day gengzi [9 Aug], the Grand Commandant Ma Midi was made Grand Tutor with control of the Secretariat.In the eighth month the General of Chariots and Cavalry Huangfu Song was made Grand Commandant.
So Yuan Shao took over as Governor of Ji province. He claimed the authority to appoint Han Fu as General Who Displays Majesty, but Han Fu had no command and no staff.
Later, Xu Zhi was recommended as "Knowing the Way," and messengers were sent to his house offering him the post of Administrator of Taiyuan, but he again refused to go.
Of all your enemies, none are greaterthan those to the north of the Yellow River, while once you havebrought the north of the River under control, then your imperial army will have gained its full strength, and all the empire willtremble before you."
Gongsun Kang wanted to gain credit for taking Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi, so he first hid some trusted soldiers inside a stable, then invited the two men in. Even before they sat down, Gongsun Kang called the men in hiding to arrest them. Then he took their heads, and also that of Supuwan, and sent them to Cao Cao.
Before this, Zhu Zhi of Danyang had at one time served as a colonel under Sun Jian. He saw how badly Yuan Shu ruled and realised that his regime was not secure, so he urged Sun Ce to go back [to his home country] and occupy the territory east of the Yangzi.
The Master of Writing Lu Zhi also advised against calling Dong Zhuo, but He Jin would follow neither of them.
Cao Cao sent his general XiahouDun to help Liu Bei, but he was defeated by Gao Shun's forces.
Clearness is an attribute of Yang; muddiness is an attribute of Yin.
On the day gengwu [27 May] He Jin sent the Prefect of the Yellow Gates to arrest Jian Shi and execute him, and he took over his troops in camp.
Gongsun Zan was angry. He repeatedly disobeyed instructions and he plundered the people.
On the day renzi [miswritten for renwu, 10 Feb] Cao Cao killedDong Cheng, Wang Fu, Chong Ji and all their families.
Li Jue and Guo Si fought one another for months on end, and the dead were numbered in the tens of thousands.
Before this, tens of thousands of families from Nanyang and theThree Adjuncts [about Chang'an] had migrated into Yi province.Liu Yan had recruited them as soldiers, calling them the Dongzhoutroops.
How much more isthis true of fighting against Cao Cao. Yet you claim there is no goodcause!
Zhang Xiu's men came to capture him, but Dian Weigrasped two and killed them both. Then, with an angry glare and agreat curse, he died.
In the summer, in the fourth month Cao Cao went north to helpLiu Yan.
Zhang Ziqian, a man from Ji province who had surrenderedearlier, had long been an enemy of Shen Pei. He laughed at him, "Ihave done better than you, Zhengnan."
Yuan Shu also killed Yin Xiu. Only Han Rong was spared, because he was known for his virtue.
Soon afterwards Zhang Wen sent me to attack the rebel Xianlian Qiang. I knew we would have no success, but I could not avoid the duty, and so we marched."I left the Senior Major Liu Jing, with four thousand horse and foot, to camp in Anding as a show of strength.
The regulations for the feudal lords were made still more strict, and Cao Zhi's favour steadily declined.
In the twelfth month Cao Cao's army returned to Qiao.
Their statements implicated more people: the Minister Coachman Du Mi of Yingchuan, the Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk Chen Xiang, and men such as Chen Shi and Fan Pang, more than two hundred altogether.
I am frequently unwell. I ask to bring some of my forces back to Jianye: we can say it is because of my health. When Guan Yu hears, he will surely call his guards up to Xiangyang.
"These are the reasons you should follow him," explained JiaXu. "
You should consider the meaning of the humble palace of Yu of Xia and the Open Terrace of the Grand Exemplar [Emperor Wen], and preserve the poor from excessive toil."
"It is my foolish opinion that even the most earnest use of punishment will be less effective than a policy of generosity, and the most careful search after wrongdoers is not so good as showing proper respect to men of worth.
In our humble opinion, the best policy is to receive him."
Now the talents and planning of Xia Yu and Tian Yan are not necessarily superior to those of Duan Jiong, and the hosts of the Xianbi are no weaker [than were the Western Qiang]. Yet these men make meaningless calculations, and expect the operation will be complete in the space of two years. If there should be a series of military misfortunes, how will they obtain a breathing space?
On the grounds that it had been raining a long time, Dong Zhuo criticised the Excellency of Works Liu Hong before the court, implying that he should be dismissed. The order was duly issued, and Dong Zhuo took the vacant post.
Cao Cao led troops into Dong, attacked Bo Rao at Puyang and defeated him.
Before this, when Li Gao of Wei commandery was Director of Retainers, he had killed Su Qian of Hongnong on account of an old quarrel between them. Su Qian's son, Su Buwei, carried out the temporary burial but did not complete the funeral. He changed his name and gathered personal followers for vengeance.
In the winter, in the tenth month there was a comet in the EasternWell.
So you will gain reputation by yielding place to a worthier man, and you yourself will be secure as Mount Tai."
Guo Tai said, "Your worth is far beyond the common run of men!
Of all traitors and rebels in the past, none have been so bad."
Zhong Yao sent the magistrate of Xinfeng, Zhang Ji of Pingyi,to win Ma Teng over.
In the winter, in the tenth month on the day xinmao [l0 Nov] there was a comet in the Tail of the Pheasant.
Guan Yu had sent soldiers to camp at Yancheng, but as soon as Xu Huang arrived he made ramparts and ditches on a side-path to show that he planned to cut off their rear. Guan Yu's soldiers burnt their camp and fled.
Wei Zhao, a boy from Chen kingdom, asked Guo Tai, "To find a master that can teach about the classics is easy; to find a master that can teach about men is difficult. I ask to become your attendant and act as servant and cleaner in your house."
"Yet these three frontiers are still unsettled, and the imperial sway remains insecure. I beg you to grant them pardon, and use their services as they are needed."
"The late emperor died, and she met with great misfortune. She was transferred to an empty palace, and unhappily she has died young."Though her family incurred punishment, those affairs did not involve the dowager. If she is now buried apart from her husband, this will truly disappoint the expectations of the empire.
and the clothing and food for his wife and family were sufficient and no more.
So Zhao Yan announced, "We shall choose a thousand good-natured fellows from amongst the newly-joined troops to remain on guard within the passes. The rest will be shifted east."
Zhang Yang, Administrator of Henei, was an old friend of LÃ¼ Buand wanted to come to his relief. He could not manage this but hebrought out his men to make a diversion in his support at Dongshi.
Most of the leaders turned to Yuan Shao, but Bao Xin said to Cao Cao, "The ability to make plans is not common, and you are the only one who can end confusion and restore order.
Before this, Xun Shu had a grandson Yu,who was well-known for his ability while he was still young. He Yong saw and admired him and said, "Here is talent to aid a king!
and granted commissions asmilitary officers to Sun Gao and Fu Ying; their companions werealso given rewards.
In the twelfth month the Excellency over the Masses Chunyu Jia left office. The Minister of the Guards Zhao Wen became Excellency over the Masses with control of the Secretariat.
He himself cut off his beard to change his appearance, and went into the Linlu Mountains. He concealed his name and became the servant of a family of ironworkers, labouring in coal and the smoke until he was broken and worn.In two or three years no-one knew who he was.
In the end, Cao Cao never made a full enquiry. Mao Jie was dismissed, and he died at his own home.
The Colonel Dian Wei fought against Zhang Xiu. Almost allthe men about him were killed or wounded, and he himself was hit ascore of times.
Li Jue and the others agreed. They made covenant together, and led their forces, several thousand men, marching westwards day and night.
Pan Yin, a major in Jian Shi's command, was an old friend of He Jin. He went out to meet him and gave a warning look.
King Cao of WEI appointed Du Xi as Chief Clerk on Station for the lands within the passes.
I control a fleet with eight hundred thousand men, and I plan to come hunting with you in Wu."
Zhang Liao led his troops to surrender and was made General of theHousehold.
In the third month Duke Cao of WEI took command of the campaign against Zhang Lu. He planned to advance through Wudu into the territory of the Di barbarians, but the Di people had blocked the roads. Zhang He, Zhu Ling and others were sent to attack and defeat them.
As a result of this, Zang Hong hated Yuan Shao. He broke off relations and would have nothing more to do with him.
16 February 158 - 5 February 159
Other officers said, "We climb the bank to attack theenemy, and we wade in the water to board our ships; what use areland defences?" "Soldiers may win or lose," argued LÃ¼ Meng, "and no-one canbe a hundred per cent certain of success in battle. Should somethingunexpected happen, and the enemy press us closely, and our menhave not time to reach the shore, how will they get into their ships?" "Excellent," agreed Sun Quan. So he built the Ruxu Fortress.
Now, men fighting in a good cause make the best soldiers, but supplies are needed to keep them at their posts.61 You must serve the Son of Heaven as a means to gain authority over those who would not submit to you otherwise, and you must re-establish agriculture to store up military supplies. If you do this, you may gain the position of a hegemon king.
Those who support them are given praise and promotion; those who oppose them are likely to find some opportunity taken to do them harm. "Their mansions could serve as models for the palaces of kings and dukes, their treasure is comparable to that of the emperor himself. They have nothing but the best of food and drink, and even their servants and handmaidens are dressed in fine white silk.
Outwardly Wang Yun acted quietly and sought to smooth things over, but it was his private intention to aid the emperor. He possessed all the abilities expected of a great official and everyone, from the Son of Heaven to his courtiers, looked to him.
He was going to give him one of his daughters in marriage,
Dong Zhuo's personal favourites were appointed only as generals of the household or colonels. They were not given important posts.
In the winter, in the tenth month King Cao of WEI led his army against Sun Quan. In the eleventh month they arrived at Qiao.
Han Xian camped at Wenxi, while Hu Cai and Yang Feng went to Wuxiang.
He went back to Cao Cao, and Cao Cao appointed him magistrate ofLangling.
He collected his troops to face the passes, but no fighting took place.
In the summer, in the fifth month on the day jiaxu [13 Jul], last of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.
Hou Cheng was angry and frightened. In the twelfth month on the day guiyou [7 Nov 198] HouCheng, Song Xian, Wei Xu and other officers kidnapped ChenGong and Gao Shun and brought their forces to surrender.
It has been broken and abandoned for two hundred years, since the Jianwu period, but there is still a small track you can follow.
The enemy had constructed their camp from grass and bushes. As a strong wind came on to blow, Huangfu Song ordered his troops to mount the walls with tinder-grass in their hands. He sent a forward party of his strongest to travel by hidden paths to the outside of the siege-lines, where they lit great fires and sounded their battle cry. The men on the walls raised torches in reply, and Huangfu Song led a sortie from the city with drums and shouts. As they charged the enemy lines, the rebels were terrified and fled in disorder.
In the summer, in the sixth month the positions of the Three Excellencies were abolished and the posts of Imperial Chancellor and Imperial Counsellor were restored.
they should be given proper burial, the members of their households and their dependents should be brought back from exile, and all those who have been condemned to suffer proscription on their behalf should be freed of that penalty.
Chen Fan and Dou Wu were in complete accord and worked together to support the imperial house. They recommended famous and worthy men from every part of the empire, men such as Li Ying, Du Mi, Yin Xun and Liu Yu. All took place at court and shared in the affairs of government.
Soldiers will join you and the people will fight for you. In the south you can hold Jiangling, and on the north you will guard Xiangyang. You have only to give the order, and the eight commanderies of Jing province will be settled.
The prison officer said to him, "The heavenly grace has been extended, but you do not leave. Why not?"
Observing the many difficulties of the imperial house, the Minister of Ceremonies Liu Yan of Jiangxia put forward a proposal: "There are soldiers and bandits in every direction, but since the authority of the Inspectors is too slight they have no means to deal with them. Moreover, as unworthy men are appointed to office, there is further cause for rebellion.
So he invited Guan Yu to a meeting. Each side halted then- troops, the generals came forward a hundred paces and met alone, armed only with swords.
Liu Bei returned to Gongan.Many years later he learnt about this, and he sighed and said,"Anywhere in the empire, wise men think alike. Kongming [ZhugeLiang] warned me not to go, and he too was concerned over whatmight happen.
Cao Cao's officers suspected a trap, but Lou Gui said, "The empire is fallen into confusion and each leader is seeking authority from the emperor as a means to increase his power. Now Liu Zong has brought his credentials, and this shows he is completely reliable."
The empire is in turmoil, replied Zhao Yun, "no one can judge who is right, and the people are miserable as if they were hanging upside down. In my poor province we discussed affairs, and we turned to the place where there is fair government. It is not that we despise Lord Yuan, nor are we particularly biased towards you."
We may defeat them on occasion, but can we be sure of complete success? - and can we risk the danger of a long-drawn war, which would cost so much time and so many resources?
Before this, some people in that commandery had gone to a pond to wash. Seeing that the water was muddy, they said to one another in fun, pretending to be frightened, "There's a yellow dragon in the pond."
Cao Cao was worried, and asked to cede the office ofGeneral-in-Chief to Yuan Shao.
When Lu Qiang received the summons, he was angry and said, "When I die, disorder is come. If a man gives all his loyalty to the state, why should he have to answer to a jailer?"
They claimed to be staying at the capital for medical reasons, and they would have no dealings with clients or retainers.
Likewise defeating Liu Yao's detached commanders at Meiling,he went forward to Hushu and Jiangcheng and overran both places. From there he moved against Liu Yao at Qu'a.
Some people would go to the gate and send in their bids in writing for positions as magistrates, and the price varied whether the county in question was good or bad, fertile or poor.
Though a commander takes courage as the basis, he must always act wisely and with forethought. If he thinks only of physical bravery, a common fellow can match him."
Futai the King of Fuyu raided Xuantu. The Administrator of Xuantu,Gongsun Yu, attacked and defeated him.
In the summer, in the fourth month, on the day gengxu [28 May] there was great rain and hail.
That is why they have gathered in rebellion, not because they have some great leader who wishes to usurp the government and defy the law.
Then Cao Cao settled Ji province, and Xing Yong of Hejian said to Tian Chou, "For more than twenty years, since the rebellion of the Yellow Turbans, the land within the four seas has been bubbling like a cauldron, and people have become homeless refugees.
Deng Xuanzhi saw He Pu and presented all Lii Meng's argu ments. He Pu was afraid, so he came out to surrender.
Gan Ning offered a plan to Sun Quan: "The fortunes of Han decline further every day, and Cao Cao will eventually usurp power.
Wei Dun, a former officer of Liu Yu, intercepted and seized the head from the couriers, brought it back and buried it.By grace and generosity, Liu Yu had gained the affection of his people, and in the northern provinces not one of those who had migrated [into You] or who were native [to You] failed to mourn him with bitter grief.
Dong Zhuo was angry and swore, "I can destroy a man's whole family."
In the course of that year He Luan killed Yan Jun and was in turn destroyed by Wang Bi of Wuwei.
The people of Jian'an, Hanxing and Nanping made trouble; eachdistrict had more than ten thousand men.
Lu Bu had attacked Juancheng but could not capture it, and he went back west to camp at Puyang.
The [Director of the] Masters of Writing Xun Yu and the Director of Retainers Zhong Yao also believed Tian Chou should be allowed to refuse,
Rumours now spread among the people that all the men from Liang province would be killed. Dong Zhuo's former generals and colonels turned to one another in anxiety and collected their men to defend themselves.These officers said to each other, "Cai Bojie [Cai Yong] was found guilty simply because Dong Zhuo had favoured him. They have issued us no pardon, and they intend to disband our troops. If we dismiss our men today we are fish-meat tomorrow."
6: 189 AD
While the great affair is yet not settled, it is my duty to seek good servants for you. Could I conceal a worthy man just because of a private quarrel?"
"Would you obstruct the affairs of the state?" demanded Dong Zhuo, colouring.
The General of the Household Protector of the Xiongnu Zhang Xiu was on bad terms with the Southern Shanyu Hucheng. Zhang Xiu arrested and executed [Hucheng], then appointed Qiangqu, the Worthy King of the Right, as Shanyu.
In the winter, in the eleventh month WEI first established Mastersof Writing, Palace Attendants, and six ministers.
It was suggested that an officer of general's rank should be chosen and sent against him with ten thousand men. Sun Quan was reluctant, and he called in Pan Jun to ask him about it."Send five thousand men, replied Pan Jun. "They will be quite enough to deal with Fan Zhou."
Then [all] the Eastern Qiang sent messengers asking to surrender, and Liang province was once again in proper communication [with the rest of the empire].
Take the opportunity now, while Dong Zhuo remains at Luoyang and the Son of Heaven is coming to the west. Lead your men to receive the emperor, accept his orders to attack the rebels, call up additional troops and gather leaders. Then the Yuan will be pressing on the east as you attack from the west. That will take him!"
Through Chen Deng, LÃ¼ Bu had asked to be made Governor ofXu province, but this was not approved.
An amnesty was proclaimed for the empire and the reign-title was changed to Guangxi.
Someone asked Fan Pang, "What sort of a man is Guo Linzong?" Fan Pang replied, "In concealment, he does not abandon his parents; his personal morality does not necessarily keep him away from the common run of men. The Son of Heaven has not been able to obtain him as a minister, and no feudal lord has been [found worthy] to be friends with him. I can make no further comment."
The enemy brought a flood of water against the city, but Chen Qiu used the lie of the ground inside the walls to turn the flood back upon them. Each side maintained its position for more than ten days, without either being able to gain a decisive victory.
In the winter, in the eleventh month the Excellency over the Masses,Yin Song died in office.
Qian Zhao returned to his seat, then told King Qiao and the otherswho would win, who would lose, and what was the right course tofollow. They all came down from their mats, knelt in obeisance andreceived his words with respect.
Yuan Shao was embarrassed and annoyed to be lower in rankthan Cao Cao. He remarked angrily that, "There were severaloccasions Cao Cao was in danger of death, and I was quick to helphim and save him. Now he is making use of the Son of Heaven togive me orders." He sent in a memorial with excuses and refused theappointment.
Liu Zhang ordered preparations throughout his territory to welcomeLiu Bei, and Liu Bei entered the borders as if he was returning tohis own home. Wherever he passed, he received valuable gifts,worth hundreds of millions of cash.
People did become anxious and afraid, and more than a hundred thousand households from Lujiang, Jiujiang, Qichun andGuangling went east across the Yangzi, so that the territory west ofthe river was abandoned. South from Hefei there was only Huancity.
Cao Cao also fled east, disguised and with a false name. As he travelled through Zhongmou, however, the headman of a village became suspicious: he arrested Cao Cao and sent him to the county office.
Speaking casually with Liu Bei, Cao Cao observed, "You and Iare the only brave men in the empire. People like Benchu [YuanShao] simply don't count."
As a result, both [259] sides will be angry withyou, and we are afraid that you will not be able to maintain a neutralposition.
In the winter, in the tenth month Liu Biao the Inspector of Jing province sent up tribute.
Before this, when Wang Yu was Director of Retainers he allied himself to the eunuchs, and he had sought some favour of Zhang Huan, who was at that time Minister of Ceremonies. Zhang Huan refused him, and so Wang Yu accused Zhang Huan of Faction. Zhang Huan was proscribed from office [and returned to his own estates].
Lu Bu fled east to Liu Bei [in Xu province], and Zhang Miao followed Lu Bu, leaving his younger brother Zhang Chao in command of the family forces to hold Yongqiu.
"I have heard it said that if innocent people are killed and worthy men are punished, misfortune will arrive within three generations.
The emperor was furious and wanted to depose the empress, but the eunuchs spoke on her behalf and dissuaded him.
The mother of the Dowager Dou died in Bijing, and the dowager became ill from grief and remorse. On the guisi day [18 Jul] she died at the Cloud Terrace.
When King Cao of WEI heard that Guan Yu had fled, he was afraid his officers might follow him in pursuit, and he did send orders post-haste to Cao Ren, just the way Zhao Yan had said.
In the ninth month the Grand Commandant Zhang Hao left office. The Minister of Ceremonies Chen Qiu became Grand Commandant.
They told the Consultant Cao Cao about their plan. Cao Cao said, "Now to depose one emperor and set up another is a most unfortunate business for the empire.
and then, taking anyone who came, he gradually collected a few hundred men. At this time, however, he suffered a surprise attack from the chieftain Zu Lang of Jing county and was almost killed.
When the officers saw the size of Han Sui's army, they wanted to build a stockade and a moat to fight on the defensive.
Now, however, a man who cultivates his virtue obtains nothing but death.
Li Jue replied, "Morning and evening we send food. What do you want grain for?"
The Court Astronomer examined the omens, and foretold that a great minister would be executed.
Cheng Yin, Hou Xuan and Pang De all came with Zhang Lu to surrender. Duke Cao of WEI restored Cheng Yin and Hou Xuan to office, and named Pang De General Who Supports Righteousness.
Zhao Wen the Excellency over the Masses, Wang Jiang the Minister of Ceremonies, Zhou Zhong the Minister of the Guards and the Director of Retainers Guan Ge were captured by Li Jue. He was about to kill them, but Jia Xu said, "These are great ministers, how can you harm them?"
At this time Cao Cao had committed the bulk of his forces to the attack on Tao Qian. There were few soldiers left on guard, and many of the commanders and senior officials had made contact with Zhang Miao and Chen Gong.
On the day bingxu [11 Oct] the Palace Counsellor Yang Biao was made Excellency of Works.
The girl Meng was extremely good-looking, so Sun Shou had her brought into the side apartments of the palace, and she became an Honoured Lady.Liang Ji wanted to have Meng recognised as his daughter, and he changed her surname to Liang
When Liu Bei settled SHU, he divided Guanghan to form Zi- tong commandery, and appointed Huo Jun as Administrator.
When Han Fu's Chief Clerk Geng Wu, his Attendant Officer Min Chun and his Headquarters Officer Li Li heard of this, they all protested, "Ji province has a million men at arms and enough grain to last ten years.
But I must act on behalf of the court, and keep hold of talented men. How can I fall for this scheme?" He took no action.
They wanted to return home, but their own people refused to accept them, so they camped at Pingyang in Hedong.
We should not change the established ceremonial. It is the expression of an irreducible subtlety."
He went on to attack White Tiger Yan. Yan's soldiers weredefeated and he fled to Yuhang and went to Xu Zhao.
I cannot compare with him, replied Han Fu.
In the twelfth month on the day jisi [30 Dec] the emperor returned from Chang'an.
Cao Cao was planning to attack Jing province, and he sent Zhang Ji to persuade Ma Teng to leave his followers and return to court. Ma Teng promised to do so,
Liu Zhen, however, wrote to admonish him: "By choosing the spring flowers of your Retainer, Marquis, you neglect the autumn fruits of your Assistant. I fear that my humble writings will bring slander and a heavy penalty upon you. I am truly con cerned about this."
At the behest of Dong Zhuo the excellencies presented memorials to justify the actions of Chen Fan, Dou Wu and the men of Faction. Their titles and ranks were restored, envoys were sent to offer mourning sacrifices to them, and their sons and grandsons were selected for office.
Between the old brigand and me, one must lose out. You say I should attack, and that is just what I think too. Heaven has sent you to me."
If you press the collection ofsilk, however, men of mean spirit will be glad to make trouble.Surely this is a mistaken policy?"
The Grand Tutor Ma Midi and the Minister Coachman Zhao Qi, each bearing a Staff of Authority, were despatched by edict to make peace with the east of the passes.
The Eastern Supporter Zheng Hun said,11 "If Liang Xing andhis fellows were defeated and scattered, they would take refuge inthe mountains and valleys. He does have a following, but he holdsthem together only by force.
Next day, wearing armour and carrying a two-point lance, Zhang Liao was the first to break the enemy lines. He killed several dozen men, took the heads of two high officers, and gave a great shout to make known his name. He crossed the rampart and came to Sun Quan's standard.
your servants were fearfill as if Heaven and Earth were felling. We beg you to take this as warning for a lifetime."
"Now the late Dowager of the Palace of Prolonged Joy still held her honourable title when she died, she held government for a time as regent, and she personally chose our present wise and sage-like ruler. This is a great and splendid achievement for the maintenance of the imperial line.
The Regular Attendant Hou Lan and the Attendant of the Yellow Gates Duan Gui both had farm properties near the borders of Jibei.Their retainers and clients robbed and plundered over a wide territory.
Aided by Yan Kuang, General of the Household in Charge of Agriculture in Yingchuan,Wang Bi attacked them and cut off their heads.
Tian Feng, Attendant Officer of Ji province, said to Yuan Shao,"Cao Cao has engaged Liu Bei and he will not be able to break offeasily. If you take the army against his rear, you can settle things atonce."
Yuan Shao sent his officer Yan Liang to attack Liu Yan the Admini strator of Dong commandery at Boma. Ju Shou said, "Yan Liangis careless and impatient He is brave, but he cannot manage alone."
His wife, however, said to him, "Chen Gong and GaoShun have quarrelled in the past. Once you have gone they willcertainly disagree about how to defend the city. If something goeswrong how will you manage alone? "Furthermore, Cao Cao treated Gongtai [Chen Gong]8 like hisown son, but he still left him and came back to us.
He had Yuan Tan succeed to the inheritance of his[Yuan Shao's] elder brother, and sent him out as Inspector of Qingprovince.
She went out to greethim, bowed once, then called, "Gentlemen, show yourselves!" SunGao and Fu Ying came out together and killed Gui Lan, and theother men went and killed Dai Yuan
Zhu Jun fought the rebel Bo Cai and was defeated. Huangfu Song went forward to hold Changshe.20
He crossed the Lu River torelieve Gongping, and the Wuhuan fled back across the borders.
The Regular Attendants Su Kang and Guan Ba had enclosed good farmland and fine properties throughout the empire, while the provincial and commandery authorities had not dared to make any objection. [Though it was not strictly within his area of responsibility,] the Minister of Finance Liu You sent in a letter on the matter, suggesting their lands and properties should be confiscated in accordance with their nature and the circumstances.
Yuan Shu sent Sun Jian to attack Liu Biao. Liu Biao sent his officer Huang Zu to meet the invasion between Fan and Deng.Sun Jian attacked Huang Zu and defeated him, and went on to besiege Xiangyang.
In the autumn in the seventh month the Excellency of Works Lai Yan left office.
Yuan Shao, moreover, treated the people and barbarians well, and Yuan Shang and his brother are still there.
Surrounding the gate tower, they called the Excellency over the Masses Wang Yun to come out, saying, "What fault had the Grand Master [Dong Zhuo]?"
Now the emperor became even more angry. He had Li Ying and the others sent down to the Prison of the Northern Office of the Yellow Gates.
In the winter, in the tenth month Cao Cao went north from Chang'anto attack Yang Qiu. He besieged Anding,
You have talent and understanding; I hope you will do your best.
Yanxi å»¶ç¹ 9: 166 AD
"Now it is my observation that, since the time of the Chunqiu, and in all the reigns of the emperors and kings of the past, there has been no occasion that the Yellow River has run clear.
Ma Teng had some private request of Li Jue, but did not get what he wanted. Angry, he planned to raise troops against the capital. The emperor sent messengers to encourage reconciliation, but Ma Teng refused.
and appointed Zhang Xiu General Who ManifestsFirmness. He recommended Jia Xu as Bearer of the Mace, andenfeoffed him as marquis of a chief village.
Zhong Yao observed, however, "TheYuan are strong and Guo Yuan is coming against us. The peopleinside the passes have secret contact with him, and the only reasonthey have not rebelled is because they respect our authority.
"Even though Jizhou [Yuan Shang] 12 may act insolently andfail to conduct himself as a younger brother, a generous ruler shouldnonetheless bend his will, humble himself, and concentrate onbringing affairs to success.
If you fail to act now that we are strong, then one day we may be gone, and should you wish to muster your forces again, how will you manage?"
In the summer, Cao Cao led his army back to Dingtao.
When Cao Cao fought with Ma Chao and his fellows on thebanks of the Wei, all the supplies for the army came from Hedong,
Ling Tong was angry that Gan Ning had killed his father Ling Cao. He always wanted to kill Gan Ning, but Sun Quan ordered him not to make trouble, and he stationed Gan Ning and his troops elsewhere.
In the eighth month Huangfu Song fought the Yellow Turbans at Cangting and captured their leader Bu Si.
Zhou Yu came out to welcome him, but said immediately, "Youmust be tired, Ziyi, for you have travelled a [408] long way acrossrivers and lakes. Was it just to be a mouthpiece for Master Cao?" Then he escorted Jiang Gan all around the camp. They lookedat the granary and the stores, the arsenal and the accounts of armourand weapons.

The School at the Gate of the Vast Capital was established. It was ordered that provincial and commandery administrations, and the Three Excellencies, should nominate students. Some [of those who graduated] went out as Inspectors or Administrators, others were appointed in the central government as Masters of Writing or Palace Attendants. Several of them were enfeoffed as marquises or given lesser orders of noble rank. All true scholars and gentlemen felt ashamed to be classed with such fellows.
They had a letter from Dong Zhuo [ordering his arrest] but only the Officer of Merit recognised him. He thought it wrong that one of the leading men in the empire should be imprisoned when the world was in such disorder, so he advised the magistrate to release him

Some ten days later, Xiang Kai sent in another: "I have heard that King Zhou of Yin loved women, and that was why Daji appeared. The Duke of She was fond of dragons, and a real one came to his court.
The Beauty Wang had given birth to a son Liu Xie. The Dowager Dong brought him up herself, and he was called Lord Dong.
Bao Xin said to Cao Cao, "Yuan Shao is leader of the covenant, but he is using that position to his own advantage. He will himself rebel and become another Dong Zhuo.
He Xia, Senior Clerk in the office of the Chancellor, said to CaoCao, "Each man varies in ability and character, and you cannotjudge them from only one aspect.
He whispered to Jia Xu, "What do we do now?"
but Xun Yusaid, "Yuan Shao has just been defeated, and his followers will beunhappy. You should take advantage of his difficulties and settlewith him for good.
In the ninth month on the day xinhai [25 Oct] Dou Wu had left the palace to spend the night at his own residence.

Yuan Shao builthigh towers and raised hills of earth to shoot down into the camp.Everyone had to wear shields over them to move about.
Of those who discussed the matter, only Zhong Yao agreedwith Chen Qun. No-one else believed that his proposals were [461]practicable.
In the third month Cao Cao sent the Director of Retainers ZhongYao to attack Zhang Lu, and the Protector of the Army WhoSubdues the West Xiahou Yuan and others were dispatched withtroops to move out from Hedong and join up with Zhong Yao.
Liu Qi took the point, and made secret plans to leave the capital.
Liu Wangzhi would not follow this advice, and he too later came to grief. Liu Yi fled to Yang province.
Zhang Song said to him, "LordCao's troops have no match in the empire. If he can use Zhang Lu'sresources to seize the territory of Shu, who can resist him? "Liu Yuzhou [Liu Bei] is a fellow clansman of yours and aconfirmed enemy of Lord Cao. He is extremely good at usingsoldiers.
If both of youwould cut the heads off some of your false ministers and become friends again, you could control the whole country and act in theempire as you please."
But now it appears that the men of Faction are servants of the state while you people follow Zhang Jue. Why shouldn't I have you beheaded?"The eunuchs kowtowed and said, "This was all the fault of Wang Fu and Hou Lan."
As Zhang Chun and Qiuliju plundered in the four provinces of Jing, Xu, You and Ji, an edict ordered the Commandant of Cavalry Gongsun Zan to attack them.

I shall deal first with Yuan Shao, then send troops against Liu Dai."

In the course of this fighting Bao Xin was killed. Cao Cao offered a reward for the recovery of his body but it could not be found. He carved a piece of wood to take the appearance of Bao Xin, then made sacrifice and held a mourning ceremony before it.
Fa Zheng said to Zhuge Liang, "In former times, when Gaozu entered the passes, he reduced the number of the laws to just three sections, and the people of Qin recognised his virtue.
"If he has to wait without supplies, his own situation will forcea retreat within three months. When he retreats, we attack him. Thisway we can certainly deal with him."
Before this, Sun Ce had killed Xu Gong the Administrator ofWu commandery, and Xu Gong's retainers had concealed them selves among the people in hope of avenging him.
Guan Jing, however, advised against this plan, "Your troops areon the point of collapse, and the only reasons that they still hold onare that they are concerned for their families and they rely upon youas their leader.
Before this, Liu Ju had been magistrate of Yongqiu, where he acquired influence over the people by his courtesy and his humility.When anyone came with a case for litigation, he would have them brought to him for a personal interview, would listen to their complaints and advise them of his belief that it was better to settle even the most bitter quarrels by agreement, rather than let aformal case go to his official tribunal.Then he would tell the antagonists to go back and think the matter over again.
If I make myself the opposite of Cao Cao in everything, [431] then the affairmay be successful.
In this year there were constructed the Jade Sceptre Park for Bird Netting and the Park of Spiritual Jade.
On the day dingwei [29 Nov] Yang Feng, Dong Cheng and Yang Ding intended to attack Duan Wei. They sent Chong Ji and Zuo Ling to ask the emperor for an edict against him.

"Better wait until he comes further forward," considered LÃ¼ Bu,"then drive him into the Si River." [234]

Ma Yuanyi came in and out of the capital several times, he gained the support of the Regular Attendants Feng Xu and Xu Feng, and they agreed on the fifth day of the third month [3 April 184] for a coup at the inside and an attack from without.
Guan Yu sent messengers several times to LÃ¼ Meng to exchange news, and LÃ¼ Meng treated them most generously. He took them around the city, and each household sent word [to their relatives with Guan Yu's army]; some wrote in their own hand to show it was trustworthy.
and Ma Chao came out tofight while Xiahou Yuan was still more than two hundred li fromthe city. Xiahou Yuan attacked him, but without success.

Before this, the Protector of the Qiang Tian Yan had been found guilty and sentenced for some fault. He had since received a pardon, but he now wanted to establish some achievement in order to restore his credit. He asked the Regular Attendant Wang Fu to get him a military command, and Wang Fu recommended that he be granted troops to join Xia Yu in the attack.
At the instigation of the Attendant at the Yellow Gates Xu Huang, the Court Astronomer Chen Shou presented the inter-pretation that "The ill omen of the sun concerns the General-in-Chief Liang Ji."

Then, however, from Emperor Xiao-He onwards, relatives by marriage seized power, and eunuchs gained control of affairs. 96Rewards and punishments were issued without proper rule, bribery was a public business, worthy men and fools were mixed together, right and wrong were confused. This may be called disorder.
The Master of Writing Zhu Mu objected to the eunuchs' abuse of power,and he sent in a letter, saying: "I note that in the old system of Han some Regular Attendants were chosen from full gentlemen. It is only since the Jianwuperiod [25-55 AD, in the time of the founding Emperor Guangwu of Later Han], that all these positions have been given to eunuchs.
Fa Zheng was currently with Liu Bei's army, so Zhuge Liangrecommended that Yang Hong act for him as Administrator of Shucommandery. All affairs of the people were well-managed, and he was then given permanent appointment.
Dong Zhuo had only just taken power, and he knew that Yuan Shao came from a great family, so he did not dare harm him.
how much worse will it become if [such loyal officers] are condemned more harshly, and their blood is shed.
In the third month on the day wushen [2 Apr] the Intendant of Henan He Jin was made General-in-Chief and was enfeoffed as Marquis of Shen. He took command of the guards of the divisions of the Right and of the Left and of the Feathered Forest, together with the five regiments [of the Northern army] and led them to camp at the Capital Watch-House. They prepared weapons and equipment to keep order in the capital. Commandants were appointed for the eight passes of Hangu, Taigu, Guangcheng, Yique, Huanyuan, Xuanmen, the Meng Crossing and the Xiaoping Crossing.
Asked the reason for all this, Gongsun Zan replied, "At first, when I drove the barbarians away beyond the borders, and destroyed the Yellow Turbans at the Meng Crossing, it seemed that the empire might be settled with the signal of a flag.
The emperor decreed that there should be a full court conference on the matter, with excellencies and ministers, and that the Regular Attendant Zhao Zhong should adjudicate.
while the Grand Tutor Chen Fan and the General-in-Chief Dou Wu investigated other members of their faction, seeking to cleanse the court and the government.

The Yang body [of man] is pure and strong, and so is enabled to extend itself; the Yin body [of woman] is obedient, and so is able to accomplish transformation. If pleasure is enhanced by ceremony, then your spirit will be regulated in its activity, and you will be thus enabled to achieve the flourishing good fortune of sons and grandsons, and the limitless happiness of long life into old age.
Du Kui, however, observed, "You do not have the title Sonof Heaven. To assemble such an orchestra and have it play in court,is that proper behaviour?" Liu Biao abandoned the idea.
Shu commandery, Guanghan and Jianwei all joined him. [299-303]
Some time later Xun Yu asked Cao Cao, "That time you knewthe enemy would be defeated: how could you tell?"
At this time those who had fled the dangers generally lived in the south of [Gongsun Du's] commanderies, but Guan Ning went to live in the north, to show that he had no intention of returning. Other refugees steadily came to join him, and in a very short time a complete town had grown up.
Liu Bei made his rebellion just a short time ago,so he cannot have his troops under full control. If you movepromptly you are sure to defeat him."
He Jin took fright and galloped straight back to his quarters. He led out his troops to camp at the Commandery Lodgings,6 and from there he announced that he was ill and could not come to the palace.
Yuan Shu said,"LÃ¼ Bu refused me his daughter. It is right and natural that heshould be defeated. Why do you come again?"
If I want it, who shall say me no?
In the summer, in the fourth month Cao Cao came to Ye.
In the ninth month the Excellency over the Masses Xu Xiang left office, the Excellency of Works Ding Gong was made Excellency over the Masses, and the Minister of the Imperial Household Liu Hong of Nanyang became Excellency of Works.

Yuan Shao again urged He Jin, "In the past, when Dou Wu planned to kill the palace favourites, the only reason he came to grief was because he allowed the news to leak out. "The men of the five regiments [of the Northern Army] feared the eunuchs and were prepared to obey them, but Dou Wu had counted on those troops, so he brought misfortune upon himself.
Xu You has insulted me, said Cao Cao. "How can I disregard that?"
Just for the moment, Chen Gong and his fellows are obliged to be friendly with him, but they will never accept him as their chief. Though he has many soldiers, he will come to nothing in the end.
Before this, when Lu Su heard of Liu Biao's death, he said to Sun Quan, "Jing province is a direct neighbour to our state. The Yangzi and the mountains are difficult to approach and secure to defend, there are ten thousand li of fertile territory and the people are prosperous. If we can take and hold it, it can become the base for an empire.
Then provinces and commanderies set up farming officesone after another and the granaries were filled.
Realising their plans had been discovered, however, they sent messengers riding day and night with orders for the Divisions to rise together. They wore pieces of yellow cloth as a badge, and the people of that time called them the Yellow Turban rebels.
On the day wuxu [20 Nov] Guo Si's partisans Xia Yu, Gao Shi and others were planning to force the emperor back to the west.
"If there were no concern that we might be invaded, then [such an attack as is currently proposed] could certainly be feasible; but how can we estimate the long-term chances of evenly-balanced warfare with an enemy numerous as ants?
At this time the Grand Commandant Li Xian was ill. He got out of his sickbed, supported himself by a small carriage, [and went to the conference] taking with him a potion offagara.He said to his wife, "Unless the dowager receives the samesacrifices as the late Emperor Huan, I shall not return alive."
You hold the imperial authority, and all essential military strength. With the leap of a dragon and the pace of a tiger, you may act as you will."The present plan, however, is like pumping up fire in a stove when all that is needed is to singe a hair.
each carrying letters to tell the newsto the commander of the garrison at Hefei. One group got into thecity, but the other two were captured by Sun Quan.
If you attack now, without waiting for reinforcements, then the booty you will gain will be so great that the few pieces you have lost will not be worth remem-bering."

Yuan Tan reported that he was indifficulties, and Yuan Shang left Shen Pei to hold Ye city while hewent in person to help Yuan Tan against Cao Cao.

while Zheng Tai fled to Yuan Shu.Xun You spoke and ate and drank as usual. Soon afterwards Dong Zhuo died and he was released.
Emperor Huan sent an edict to ask Duan Jiong, "The Xianlian and [other tribes of] the Eastern Qiang act wickedly and rebelliously. Huangfu Gui and Zhang Huan have each held command of strong forces, but they have not been able to settle them in any reasonable time. I am thinking of giving you orders to move troops east for a new campaign, but I do not know whether this is a good idea. May I have your comments?"
When Liu Bei met Zhao Yun, he admired him and showed him particular friendship. Zhao Yun followed Liu Bei to Pingyuan and commanded cavalry for him.
Jian'an 20: 215 AD
But Cao Cao still controls two-thirds of the empire, and he plans to water his horses at the ocean shore and review his troops in Wu and Kuaiji. Why should he be willing merely to keep what he has and wait for old age?
Cao Zhi acted often upon impulse and paid no attention to his conduct, while the General of the Household for All Purposes [CaoPi] could plan things in advance and act against his true nature.All the maidservants and attendants of the palace praised him and spoke on his behalf, and so he was established as Heir.
You have too few soldiers to maintain defence; you should accept the invitation of these Qiang and other tribespeople and go back to our homeland. Wait until a worthy man appears, and then join him."
Su Fei has escaped the misfortune of having his head dividedfrom his body, replied Gan Ning, "and he has received the gift of a new life. Even if we drove him away he would not go. Why should he plan to escape?

All but a very few left the territory or died of starvation.
And later I took over in Yan province; and I destroyed orbrought to surrender three hundred thousand Yellow Turbans; and Iattacked the rebel Yuan Shu and caused him to die poor and ruined;and I destroyed Yuan Shao and exposed the heads of his two sons;and I also dealt with Liu Biao.

In the third month Liu Chang, Reverent King of Zhongshan, died. He had no sons, and the kingdom was abolished.
The Wu and Ji Colonel and the Chief Clerk of the Western Regions each raised troops to assist in establishing Dingxing, the hostage prince, as king. The number of his people was barely a thousand.

when he met young men, he gave them good advice about filial piety and the respect owed to elder brothers. All the people were pleased and affected by his example.
Unless we take them now, they will surely cause trouble later."
Sun the General Who Exterminates Caitiffs, replied Lu Su, "is wise and generous. He respects worthy men and treats scholars with courtesy. All the leaders of the lands beyond the Yangzi have joined him, and he now controls six commanderies. His soldiers are well-trained, he has quantities of supplies, and he is strong enough to maintain his independence.
When Chen Deng cameback, LÃ¼ Bu was angry. He took up a halberd and chopped the table,saying, "Your father persuaded me to join Cao Cao and to break offthe marriage with Gonglu [Yuan Shu]. Now my request has notbeen granted but you and your father have both done splendidly.You sold me out."
Liu Yu, Governor of You province, arrived in his territory and sent messengers with warnings to the Xianbi. He demanded they send the heads of Zhang Ju and Zhang Chun; they would be well rewarded.
But Yang Yuanqun gave bribes to the eunuchs, and in the end he managed a successful counter-accusation against Li Ying.
Yuan Shao was forced to kill Geng Bao inorder to clear himself.
In the autumn, in the seventh month the Grand Commandant Xu Xun left office.
The Excellency over the Masses Sheng Yun left office.The Minister of Finance Chong Gao became Excellency over the Masses.
Dou Wu's grandson Dou Fu was at this time aged two sui. Hu Teng pretended that Dou Fu was his own child, and with the Foreman Clerk Zhang Chang of Nanyang they went to hide him in Lingling commandery. So his life was also spared.
So Dong Zhuo stopped, and did no more than dismiss Lu Zhi from office. Lu Zhi fled to Shanggu and lived there in seclusion.
The Dongzhou menwere afraid they would be punished and destroyed, so they joinedforces [with Liu Zhang] and Zhao Wei was driven back. Theypursued him to Jiangzhou and killed him there.
Yang Ci was the son of Yang Bing.
Xun Yu had always acted honourably, his conduct was uprightand he was wise in counsel. He loved to recommend worthy menand to promote scholars. All the people of the time mourned hisdeath.
If you attack quickly, before LÃ¼Bu recovers his spirit and Chen Gong can decide upon a plan, LÃ¼Bu can be taken."
Now Cao Ren and his comrades are under heavy siege, observed Huan Jie. "Yet they have no hesitation in holding to the death. This is because your majesty shows strength for them at a distance.
In the third month on the day guihai [?]29 there was a fall of meteorites at Hu.
In the army there was fear and trembling, and no one even dared to pick things up that had been dropped and were lying on the roads.
Zhuge Liang said to Liu Bei, "The matter is now urgent. Please give me authority to seek help from General Sun."
When Yuan Shao heard Cao Cao had attacked Chunyu Qiong, hesaid to his son Yuan Tan, "As Cao Cao is defeating Chunyu Qiong,I shall take his camp and he will have nothing to return to."
Shen Pei's nephew, Shen Rong, was colonel at the easterngate.15 In the eighth month, on the day wuyin [13 Sep], Shen Rongopened the gates during the night and let Cao Cao in.
Han Sui led his forces to make peace between Ma Teng and Li Jue, but then he too joined Ma Teng.
If you do not do this, I am afraid there will be serious trouble in the future."
The Regular and Yellow Gate attendants all went to He Jin and apologised, assuring him they were at his service. "
Zhao Yan tactfully explained the situation to them, consoled them and encouraged them. All then responded to him and cried, "For life or death we shall follow the Protector. We would not dare be disloyal."
Cao Cao appointed him Counsellor[241] Remonstrant and Adviser to the Army of the Excellency ofWorks.
Shangliao is extremely rich. I ask you to deal with them and shall bring my troops to support you out side."
He observed how the times were falling into disorder and danger, while his own family was prosperous and affluent, and he would sigh and rebuke his cousins, "Our excellent ancestor [Yuan An] was favoured and honoured, but later generations are lacking in the virtue which might enable them to maintain [that high position]. Instead, they contend in arrogance and extravagant living, and they struggle for power in an age of disorder. This is like the three Que of Jin."
Some time later, when Guo Tai was returning to his native commandery, all scholars of official rank came to the Yellow River to make their farewells. There were several thousand carriages there. Li Ying was the only one to cross the river in the boat with Guo Tai, and the others looked upon them from afar as if [Guo Tai and Li Ying] were spirits or immortals.
On theother hand, while fine scholars such as Zuo Chengzu and Liu Yixunwere invited to sit with him, that was all, for he would never discussmatters of government with them. He said nonetheless, "These arefamous men and people look up to them. I must not lose them."
Before this, the Palace Attendant Liu Shu, an elder brother of the Excellency over the Masses Liu He, had been involved in the plot with Dou Wu [against the eunuchs in 168] and had died at the same time.
When Yuan Shao came to attack,the various camps on Gongsun Zan's southern borders realised theywere too weak to defend themselves against him, and they knewthere was no chance of relief. Some surrendered, others ran away,
The people of the kingdom set up his son the worthy King of the Right Yufuluo as Zhizhi shizhuhou Shanyu.
Many of Liu Zong's attendants and the people of Jing province turned to Liu Bei.
"Now that I know I shall be blamed in this way, I realise that I face instant death. I ask only five days more, to destroy and eliminate the sources of evil. Then I can readily accept even the punishment of being boiled alive. This is my life's desire."
Fan Xian wanted to kill Du Ji in order to intimidate the people,but for the time being he waited to see what he would do. Hebeheaded the Registrar and some thirty other officers [of thecommandery] outside his gate, but Du Ji showed no sign of anxiety.
Zhou Yu's uncle Zhou Shang was at this time Administrator of Danyang. Zhou Yu brought soldiers to welcome Sun Ce and again gave him help with supplies and food.
LÃ¼ Bu's officer He Meng of Henei attacked LÃ¼ Bu during the night. LÃ¼ Bu fled bareheaded and unclothed to the camp of his Chief Controller Gao Shun,
For a long time now, the Southern Xiongnu had been settled within the borders.They were much the same as the registered inhabit ants, but they sent no tribute or tax.
Though Sun Ce had held Kuaiji, Wu commandery, Danyang,Yuzhang, Lujiang and Luling, there was still difficult country whichhad not been brought fully under control.
So Yuan Shu mobilised troopsto give LÃ¼ Bu moral support.
Before this, He Jin had sent Zhang Yang of Yunzhong to go back to Bing province and raise troops. Soon afterwards He Jin came to grief, and Zhang Yang stayed in Shangdang with a force of several thousand men.
Xun Yu, however, said, "From the very beginning, when LordCao raised loyal troops to save the emperor and give peace to thestate, he has kept his faith with loyalty and honesty and hasmaintained his honour by withdrawing and yielding.
Xu Huang brought his troops in order back to the Mo Slope, and Cao Cao came out seven li from his camp to welcome him.
"Your family has been successful and prosperous for many generations, but it still cannot compare with the splendour of the rulers of Zhou. And though the house of Han is weak, it cannot be likened to the cruelty of Yin." Yuan Shu was silent.
Yuan is the hero of the age, said Xun Shen, "and in these three ways your abilities fail to match his fine qualities. Though you have long held position above him, he will certainly not be satisfied to remain your underling.
Cui Yan obtained the manuscript of Yang Xurfs memorial, read it through, and then wrote to him, nI have examined your memorial and it is excellent.
Yuan Shao hadlaid an ambush to surprise him, and Gongsun Zan was heavilydefeated.
LÃ¼ Meng argued that he was toobusy with military affairs,
When Liu Kui, King of Bohai, was demoted to Yingtao, he had sought the good offices of the Regular Attendant Wang Fu to regain his original fief, and he promised to pay Wang Fu fifty million cash as a thanks offering.When Emperor Huan restored Liu Kui in his testamentary edict, however, Liu Kui realised that Wang Fu had had no influence on the matter, and he was not willing to redeem his pledge.
21 February 163 - 10 February 164
The emperor asked again, "What harm do men of Faction do, that you want to punish them?"
In the second month on the day xinyou [9 Mar] Emperor Xiaohuan was buried at Xuanling.His temple name was Weizong.
Liu Yu sent in a memorial that all the troops in camp should be disbanded, leaving only Gongsun Zan, Colonel Who Brings the Caitiffs to Surrender, with command of ten thousand horse and foot in Youbeiping.
The Grand Commandant Huang Wan said, "This is a question of national importance. Should you not give some attention to Lord Yang's argument?" Dong Zhuo made no reply.
Seven or eight thousand men and women lay dead one upon the other, but none went away or turned against him.
The Banshun barbarians of Ba commandery made a rebellion. The Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk Xiao Yuan was sent to take command over the Inspector of Yi province and attack them. The campaign was not successful.
Someone reported it, and Sun Quanbeheaded all Sun Fu's close [296] companions, redistributed hisfollowers, and exiled him to the east.
They went forward to the rebel camps.When a count was made it was found that eight hundred of the mutineers had scattered into the countryside,
Before they arrived Gongsun Zan had secretly sent a messengerwith a letter to Gongsun Xu, telling him to lead five thousandarmoured cavalry into the marshes to the north and light a fire as asignal. Then Gongsun Zan would make a sortie from inside thecity.
He was going to follow hissuccess against Yuan Shao with an attack on Liu Biao,
Then Fan Pang went south to his home in Runan, and when the leading men of the commandery came out to welcome him their carriages were numbered in the thousands. Yin Tao and Huang Mu, men from his native village, acted as guards at his side, and helped in receiving his guests.
Sun Ce captured Liu Yao's camp at Niuzhu, and all the grain and weapons stored there.
The emperor gave his assent and agreed to all that Duan Jiong had proposed. At this, Duan Jiong took command of more than ten thousand soldiers, with supplies for fifteen days, and went from Pengyang direct to Gaoping. He fought with the Xianlian tribes at Fengyi Mountain.
Furthermore, the rain and floods have helped us move in, but if we stay too long the water will go down and the return will be difficult. It is my humble opinion that the situation can become dangerous.
In an age of confusion, it is unsafe to keep near any leading man. Wait long enough, and slander and misfortune are certain to come."
So he gathered the people together, set walls and out-works inorder and made preparations for defence. And he called on thepeople to drive away the bandits and to capture their treasure andtheir women, rewarding them with seven-tenths of everything theygot.
The general Sun He was in camp at Jing city, and he hurried to Wanling, butGui Lan and Dai Yuan killed him too.
There was constant turmoil in the court at this time, and law and order were poorly maintained. Li Ying, however, retained his composure and his sense of proper administration and integrity. Such was his fame that gentlemen who were received and interviewed by him were described as having "climbed the Dragon Gates."
Guan Yu grantedhim a seal and gave him soldiers, and he came back as a bandit. In the area south from Xu city there were others who acted as allies to Guan Yu behind the lines.Guan Yu's power made central China tremble.
After more than a month, the culprits had still not been found.The Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk Duan Jiong was appointed in his stead.
He Qi secretly gathered light-armed and agile men and brought them to a hidden pass. They used iron halberds to climb the mountain,then let down a cloth to bring up the men below.
Unless you get Liu Yuchou,then the enemy will attack outside and the people will oppose youwithin, and that is the way to certain destruction.
In the autumn, in the ninth month Cao Cao returned to Xu city.
He turned to Chi Lii, "Under heaven, my lord Chi, how can this be?"
Then an edict appointed LÃ¼ Bu General of theLeft, and Cao Cao sent a letter in his own hand, full of encourage ment and praise.
Zhang Huan was appointed Minister of Finance and enfeoffed as a marquis for his good work.
Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi, with Tadun, the Shanyu Louban of Liaoxi and the Shanyu Nengchendizhi of Youbeiping,came with tens of thousands of horsemen to oppose them.
Once Xu is captured, then we holdthe emperor and can attack Cao Cao in his name, while Cao Caobecomes an outlaw.
Startled and frightened, King Qiao ran barefoot to grasp QianZhao and ask mercy for Han Zhong. All his attendants turned pale.
This is not the right way to do things. Your advice offered the plan for complete safety, and for that I give rewards. Do not hesitate to speak up in future."
At one time, the Consultant Zhao Yan had been advising the emperor on current affairs and policies, but Duke Cao of WEI disapproved of this and killed him.
In the eighth month the Excellency of Works Wang Chang left office and the Minister of the Imperial Clan Liu Chong became Excellency of Works.
If we answer the summons today, they will destroy us and our families tomorrow. What shall we do?"
Chen Gong said, "That rebel bandit Cao Cao, how can you callhim 'excellent master'? If you surrender to him you will be like anegg thrown at a stone. Do you expect to survive?"
If you still feel that I should hold an appointment here, then I would ask for some secondary post in order that I may act as his assistant."
Wang Guo is strong, but when he has attacked Chencang and failed to take it, his army will certainly be in low spirits. When they are discouraged, we shall attack them. That is the way to complete success. Why would you relieve the city?"Wang Guo attacked Chencang for more than eighty days, but was unable to capture it.
Yuan Shao said to his officers, "I did not use Tian Feng's advice,
Someone wrote on the tower of the Gate of the Vermilion Bird: "The empire is in great disorder. Cao Jie and Wang Fu have imprisoned and killed the dowager. The excellencies and ministers draw their salaries but do nothing. No-one speaks out loyally."
Your servant Sima Guang remarks:"Heaven and Earth are the parents of all creatures, and the most highly endowed of these is man. The sincere, intelligent and perspicacious among men becomes the great sovereign, and the great sovereign is parent of the people."
For his part, the emperor also reviewed the memorials that Cai Yong had sent. The edict ordered "Remission of death by one degree. [The accused] and their dependents shall be shaved and collared and banished to Shuofang. They shall not benefit from any amnesty."
Cao Cao was pleased andsaid, "Here is real attention to duty?"
As he passed Yuzhang, he sent LÃ¼ Fan, General of the House hold Who Subdues the Caitiffs, to pacify Poyang, and Cheng Pu,General of the Household Who Terrifies Criminals to attack Le'an. [He also ordered] Taishi Ci, Commandant of Jianchang, to takecommand at Haihun, while the senior majors Huang Gai, Han Dang,Zhou Tai and LÃ¼ Meng were sent to occupy the important cities asmagistrates and to attack the Shanyue. All was settled.
Cao Cao has cut down his most dangerous rivals, and has settled almost all of them. Now he has overwhelmed Jing province, and his authority makes the four seas tremble.
Inadequate and worn-out as I am, I humbly await instructions.
This is a chance from Heaven. You must not let it pass!"
The Registrar Tian Yi and the head of Dong Zhuo's granary came to attend his corpse and LÃ¼ Bu killed them too. Altogether three men were killed.
In the autumn, Cao Cao led his men to attack Tao Qian. Hestormed more than ten cities, and came to Pengcheng, where there was a great battle. Tao Qian's army was defeated and he fled to take refuge in Tan.
The empress retired to the Drying House and died there of grief.
He made plans with Yuan Shao to kill the favourites. Jian Shi became concerned about this, and he sent He Xun away to serve as Intendant of Jingzhao.
Dong Zhuo namedZhang Yang as General Who Establishes Righteousness and Administrator of Henei.
When Gongsun Zan had killed Liu Yu, he held all the territory of You province, and his ambition became ever greater. He took advantage of his ability and strength, he felt no pity for the people, he recorded faults and forgot good work, and he took revenge for no more than an angry look.
Zhang Ren made a stand at the Yan Bridge, his men were defeatedand he himself was killed.
By the time Li Jue and the others came back [from their raid into Yingchuan and Chenliu] Niu Fu was dead. Li Jue and the others had nowhere to go, so they sent a messenger to Chang'an asking for pardon.
Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun had combined forces of more than forty thousand men and they marched together, each with an army, to attack [the Yellow Turbans in] Yingchuan.
Zhang Fei was defeated [189] and fled, while LÃ¼ Bu captured Liu Bei's wife and children and the families of his military and civil officers.
"I crossed the Wei and made a strong fort, and when the enemyarrived and I did not come out, that too was a device to make themfeel superior. As a result, they made no camp or fort of their own,but only asked to cede territory.
But you want to join Wu Ju? He is an ordinary fellow, far away in a distant commandery, and sooner or later someone will take him over. How can you trust yourself to him?
"Even I do not know when my turn will come!" replied the emperor.
Chen Shi said, "If I do not go to the jail, people will feel there is no one they can trust in."
Liu Biao had appointed Liu Wangzhi of Nanyang as an Assistant Officer. Two of his friends, however, were executed by Liu Biao on account of false accusations. Since he himself had made honest criticisms which were not well-received, Liu Wangzhi sent in a petition asking to go home.
I do not believe you should judge his feelings by the highs and lows of official titles nor by the size of fiefs and gifts.
Many officials and gentry who had formerly served Liu Biao nowturned to Liu Bei. Liu Bei felt the territory Zhou Yu had allocatedhim was too small to support his army, so he went in person to Jingcity 14 to see Sun Quan and to ask for appointment as AreaCommander of Jing province.
"Now your ministers take the example of Cai Yong as a warning. On the one hand they are afraid they will suffer immeasurable difficulties in their public life, and they also fear they may suffer harm from some private assassin. I know that your court will not receive honest advice again!
Dong Zhuo had not yet arrived, and matters of government large and small were left to Wang Yun.
Yuan Shao sent Qu Yi against them with eight hundred good soldiers, while a thousand Strong Bowmen supported his advance from either side.
Dou Wu went in to tell the Dowager, and they decided on the matter within the forbidden apartments of the palace.With commission as a Household Counsellor, Liu Shu and the Regular Attendant Cao Jie, both bearing Staves of Authority and leading a thousand men of the Yellow Gates, Rapid Tiger and Feathered Forest guards, were sent to escort Liu Hong [to the capital]. At that time he was age twelve sui.
Li Tan had a most tyrannical and fussy stepmother, but he treated her with the utmost respect, he obtained for her the most costly products of each of the four seasons, and every time he brought them to her he would always bow first.People of the district took his conduct as a model for their own.
Wen Chou and Yan Liang had been Yuan Shao's most cele brated captains, and in just two engagements both had been killed.Yuan Shao's men were discouraged.
When Ma Teng attacked Li Jue two sons of Liu Yan, Liu Fan and Liu Dan, were both killed.
Mi Fang and Shi Ren were both resentful of the casual way Guan Yu treated them. When he went off with the army, however, he left them in charge of transport. Supplies then failed to arrive on time. "When I get back, I shall deal with them," said Guan Yu.
Your Liu Bei is nothing special; how can he match my master? I would rather be a martyr for my state than a leader of rebels."
Ma Chao was angry, but he had maintained the siege a longtime without success, so he kept his self-control and attempted topersuade Yan Wen to change his statement.
The leaders within the passes did have suspicions, and MaChao, Han Sui, Hou Xuan, Cheng Yin, Yang Qiu, Li Kan, ZhangHeng, Liang Xing, Cheng Yi, Ma Wan and their followers, tendivisions altogether, rose in rebellion. Their combined force was ahundred thousand men, and they set encampments to guard theTong Pass.
"Now Liu Bei has reputation as a hero. If he comes to us intime of need and we kill him, it will give us a bad name for injuringa worthy man.
Alas! One may live so long, but what is there to hope for?
If you wish to support the Son of Heavenabove and Lord Cao below, then by all means send me. If you areundecided, however, and when I come to the capital the Son ofHeaven grants me a single post, I shall not be able to refuse; andthen I shall be a servant of the Son of Heaven, and my relationshipto you will be no more than that of a former officer.
On the day bingwu [5 Feb] the Marquis of Xinfeng, Shan Chao, died.He was granted funerary items from the imperial workshops of the Eastern Garden, and in his coffin he had adornments of jade.His funeral cortege was escorted by cavalry from the five regiments [of the Northern Army], and the Court Architect supervised the raisingof the tumulus.
The Counsellor Remonstrant Chong Shao, the Palace Attendant Ma Yu and the General of the Household on the Left Liu Fan made plans for Ma Teng to attack Chang'an. They would then act as his supporters inside the city and kill Li Jue and his allies.
The Yellow Turbans were now defeated and scattered, and the remnants were dealt with by provincial and commandery governments. Thousands of people were executed in a single commandery.
Then Han Song came to Xu city, and the emperor appointedhim Palace Attendant and Administrator of Lingling.
"I wish your majesty might be hard-hearted enough to get rid of these evil associates, that you take into account the general good of the empire, and respond to the wishes of Heaven.
Wang Fen was ordered to disband his soldiers, and was recalled to the capital soon afterwards.
Ma Chao and his remaining forces were camped at Lantian. XiahouYuan attacked and pacified them.
The emperor was not pleased, and said, "You're an obstinate fellow, a true descendant of Yang Zhen. When you die, there will surely be another flock of birds."
The Inspector of the Guards of the Feathered Forest Zao Zhiproposed that military agricultural colonies be set up, and Cao Caodid this. He appointed Zao Zhi Commandant of AgriculturalColonies, and made the Commandant of Cavalry Ren Jun Generalof the Household in Charge of Agriculture.
Everyone said, "Taishi Ci is sure to go off to the north and willnever come back."
Xun Shuang, a candidate recommended by the Minister of Ceremonies Zhao Dian, sent in a reply, "In ancient times, when the sages established [order] between Heaven and Earth, they called it 'Ceremony.'3 Of all the ceremonies, that of marriage is the most important.
Again, Zhang Huan joined with the Master of Writing Liu Meng and others in presenting a joint recommendation that Wang Chang and Li Ying take part in selection of the Three Excellencies.Cao Jie and his associates were still more resentful of his proposals, so they had an edict sent down with a severe reprimand.
"Your majesty is among the middle range of Han," replied Yuan Yan.
The eunuchs spoke against Liu Tao: "When the Zhang Jue business arose, imperial edicts displayed your majesty and grace, and since that time all rebels have repented.
Cao Cao led his troops on foot to escape by the Huarong road.They met with mud and mire, and the road became impassable.Heaven sent a great wind, and sick soldiers had to carry grass on their backs to fill the road before any horsemen could get through.
Zhao Zhong accepted this idea, and he sent his younger brother Zhao Yan, who was Colonel of the City Gates, to present his compliments to Fu Xie
LÃ¼Bu brought out his forces against Cao Cao several times, but he was heavily defeated in one battle after another. He went back to holdthe city [of Xiapi] and did not dare come out again.
Cao Hong led an attack on Wu Lan. Zhang Fei was camped at Gushan, and threatened that he would cut [Cao Hong's] lines of communication to the rear. All Cao Hong's advisers were uncertain.
He had chain pumps and a thirsty crow set up at the west of the bridge, to spray water down the north-south roads of the suburbs. The emperor planned that this should save his people the expense of scattering water to lay the dust.
He sent his officers Chen Shi and others to cut the Mamingge Road11 but Xu Huang attacked and defeated them.
Hu Wencai and Yang Zhengxiu [Yang Ding] were both powerful elders, respected by the men of Liang province. Calling them up, Wang Yun told them to go east and explain the situation, but not to show any leniency. "Those rats east of the passes," he said, "what do they want?
Now we ask that the Commissioner [i.e. you, Liu Bei, as Governor] collect a hundred thousand horse and foot. Above, you will give help to the ruler and relief to the people, below you can seize land for yourself and guard its boundaries. We shall not take 'No' for an answer!"
In the third month Yuan Shao was at the Boluo Crossing.
Yang Qiu of Yuyang, Chancellor of Pingyuan, was found guilty of undue cruelty and was summonsed to attend the Ministry of Justice.
I appreciate, however, that none of you have any concern in this affair, and there is no reason for you to share this ill fortune. Before the city falls you must take your wives and children and go."
Some of them ran away and were not caught, so rewards were advertised, and messengers were sent out after them, one following another, to every part of the empire.
Hou Wen was beaten fifty times, and after that everyone got full measure.
Zhang Zhao constantly received letters from scholars and gentry in the north, full of praise for him, but not for his associates. When Sun Ce heard about this, he laughed, "In olden times Master Guan [Zhong] was Chancellor in Qi. In one thing it was Father Zhong, in two it was Father Zhong, but it was Duke Huan who became the most distinguished of the hegemon rulers.
He was brave and gallant, and as he grew to maturity he became an increasingly fine scholar. He was particularly good at strategy and schemes, and for that I would put him equal to Zhou Yu; only in argument and debate did he fall short.It was LÃ¼ Meng who planned the destruction of Guan Yu, and in that he was better than Lu Su.
"Yang Feng has no friends at court," answered Dong Zhao,"and he is your ally.
In the sixth month Yuan Shu came to Jiangting.12 He sat on astretcher-bed and sighed, "So Yuan Shu is come to this!" Groaningin anger, he became ill, spat blood and died.
Huan Dian always rode a piebald horse and there was a saying about him in the capital:Walking, walking, better watch your step,Beware the Clerk on the piebald horse.
and within a few months the treasury was fiill.
In the twelfth month Cao Cao's army was at Qimen. Yuan Tancaptured Pingyuan, but went then back to hold Nanpi, setting hiscamp by the Qing River.
The Inspector of Jing province, Hu Xiu, and the Administrator of Nanxiang, Fu Fang, both surrendered.
When the Xianbi heard that Zhang Huan had left, they formed an alliance with the Southern Xiongnu and the Wuhuan to make a rebellion together.
and someone suggested to him that here was an opportunity to repay the injury. He Xun said, "If my official advice harmed a good man, it would not be loyal. If I took advantage of another's time of danger, it would not be kind." [187]
I have heard you are brave and loyal, one of the wise menof the empire, but you have not yet found the right man to follow.
So Zhang Yang endorsed Cao Cao's memorial and forwarded it to the capital,
The emperor once asked his Palace Attendant Yang Qi, "How do I compare with Emperor Huan?"Yang Qi replied, "Your majesty resembles Emperor Huan in the same manner as Yu-Shun compares in virtue with Tang-Yao."
He Jin had taken warning from Jian Shi's plot: claiming to be ill, he neither attended the mourning nor accompanied the funeral.
In the second month some bandits of Rongyang killed the magistrate of Zhongmou.
The eunuchs were full of anxiety and hatred for Li Ying and his associates, and edicts were sent down one after the other to confirm the proscription of the men of Faction.
As the emperor and his ministers left the camp on foot, the Empress' elder brother Fu De escorted her, and he carried ten rolls of silk under his arm.
Everyone was pleased for Yan Jun, but he firmly refused the appointment, saying, "I am a simple scholar, with no experience of military affairs." He spoke with the utmost sincerity and even wept.
This miserable fellow Xu You, is it worth your while to exercise your military genius against him?"
You are now hoping to hold an isolated city against him, but you realiseyourself that your resources are too limited. Unless you make adecision soon, it will be too late for regrets.
Yan Jun sent his mother and children as hostages to King Cao of WEI and asked for help. Cao Cao asked Zhang Ji about it.
Cao Cao brought his army to attack Liu Bei in Runan, and Liu Beifled to Liu Biao. Gong Du and the others were all scattered.
He sent a messenger to Chang Xi, "The Duke [Cao Cao] hassent a letter for me to hand to you."
Zhu Yu, Gong Pu, Zhang Liang and others, six in all, were enfeoffed as marquises, and a further eleven eunuchs were given secondary marquisates.
His wife called a great assembly of the family for the parting ceremony, but then, in the midst of the gathering, she rolled up her sleeves and read out a fifteen-point list of Huang Yun's guilty secrets. Then she left.
When hereturned he praised the emperor and the virtue of Lord Cao, andurged Liu Biao to send his sons to enter service.
The emperor sought to avoid this. He made a great levy of soldiers from all directions and held manoeuvres by the Lodge of Tranquil Joy. A great platform was set up, with twelve ceremonial umbrellas on top, each a hundred feet high.
Cao Cao sent Xiahou Yuan tohelp Zheng Hun attack them; they took the head of Liang Xing andthe rest of his party were all pacified.
We cannot tell how affairs will develop. This is a time when men atthe court eat late, because they are concerned about trouble to come,and the ruler has constant anxiety.
Tao Qian, Inspector of Xu province, with the chief officials of his commanderies and kingdoms, sent in a memorial recommending that Zhu Jun become Grand Master.64 And they wrote also to the other heads of provinces, urging them to join an attack on Li Jue and his followers, then invite the emperor [to come to the east].
In discussion of Zhang Huan's achievement, it was held that he was worthy of being enfeoffed but in the end, because he refused to submit to the eunuchs, he received no such reward. He was granted instead the sum of two hundred thousand cash, and the right to have one person from his family appointed as a gentleman-cadet.
"You have a point!" laughed Cao Cao. Adding to Liu Bei'ssoldiers, he gave him provisions and sent him east to Pei to collecthis scattered troops and make plans against LÃ¼ Bu.
but make him your Headquarters or AttendantOfficer, and he will find his feet." Zhuge Liang gave the sameadvice.
Before this, Xiahou Yuan had been successful in many battles, but King Cao of WEI always warned him, "The commander of an army should sometimes be timid and weak; you cannot rely merely upon your courage.
Then Cao Cao came back, and he took Cheng Yu by the hand and said, "But for your strength, I would have had no place to return to."
"Whom can we send?" asked Cao Cao. "Xu Huang can do it," replied Xun You.
Among LÃ¼ Bu's army there were soldiers from Sou [Shu], and these men staged a mutiny. In the sixth month on the day wuwu [28 Jun] they gave entry to Li Jue's army, and the soldiers broke loose to plunder.
Yuan Shang sent Guo Yuan, the Administrator of Hedong whom hehad appointed, to join Gao Gan and the Southern [311>312] Shanyuof the Xiongnu and attack that commandery. He sent messengers tomake alliance with Ma Teng and the other leaders within the passes,and Ma Teng and the others gave secret undertakings. Every city Guo Yuan passed fell to him, and only the civilofficer of Hedong commandery,
Zhang Yan had twenty or thirty thousand good soldiers and several thousand horsemen.
but now they are all taking arms against me. You have betrayed me. How can I use such un- trustworthy people?"
"How can I be worthy of all this?" laughed Cao Cao.
In the third month the Grand Commandant Huang Qiong left office.In the summer, in the fourth month the Minister of Ceremonies, Liu Ju of Pei kingdom, became Grand Commandant.
Now if you can take Lu Kang, Lujiang will certainly be yours."
The wife of Zhang Rang's son was a younger sister of the Dowager. Zhang Rang kowtowed before his daughter-in-law and said, "I am old and have acted wrongly. You and I, daughter-in-law, should retire together to private life.
That is what rulers both in ancient times and at the present day have always been careful to avoid. Should you not think this out properly? "Loyal words may offend the ear, and contrary opinions may bring enmity, but I dare not excuse myself from speaking if it may bring advantage to your honour and your wisdom."
"LÃ¼ Bu is like a wild wolf cub," observed Cao Cao, "and it will certainly be difficult to keephim under control for long. No-one but you can appreciate his truenature."
Cao Cao had always disliked Yang Xiu because he was a nephew of Yuan Shu, and when he found that he had been passing on everything he said and communicating with a feudal lord [Cao Zhi], he had him arrested and executed.
Sun Quan sent He Qi,Commandant of the Southern Region of Kuaiji, to attack them. Hepacified all the territory, re-established the counties and cities, andlevied ten thousand soldiers. He was promoted to Colonel WhoPacifies the East.
He [417] divided Yuzhang to create Poyang commandery, andChangsha to form Hanchang commandery. Cheng Pu returned asAdministrator of Jiangxia, while Lu Su became Administrator ofHanchang and camped at Lukou.
Sun Ce appointed Zhou Yu asGeneral of the Household Who Establishes Awe,
Xia Fu's younger brother Xia Jing took silken cloth to search for him and take supplies. Xia Fu refused to accept the offerings, saying, "How can you seek to offer gifts to one who would bring you misfortune?"
When this became known, the whole camp was disturbed, and nothing anyone could say would calm the men.
In the eighth month Cao Cao went east to deal with the pirate Guan Cheng. When he came to Chunyu, he sent his officers Yue Jin and Li Dian to attack Guan Cheng. They defeated him and Guan Cheng fled to islands in the sea.
Some people found a jade seal in the ground, and his followerswanted to honour Zhang Lu as King of Hanning.
Fu Xie the Administrator of Hanyang said to Geng Bi, "Commissioner, you do not have great experience in administration, and the people are not yet accustomed to you.
Cao Cao sighed and said, "If I had had you earlier, the empirewould have been no problem."
Just as you have five generations succeeding one another as great ministers of the Han, a splendour and favour to which none may compare, so you should express your loyalty and maintain your honour as a subject, to repay the royal house. Then you will have the good reputation of Dan [the Duke of Zhou] and Shi [the Duke of Shao]. All the world will admire you.
In the past, Zhu Han had been treated rudely by Han Fu, and he now sought to anticipate Yuan Shao's intentions. Without authority he brought troops to surround Han Fu's house and went in carrying a sword. Han Fu fled to the upper storey, but Zhu Han seized his eldest son, beat him and broke both his legs.
So he sent Ni Heng to Liu Biao, who received him as anhonoured guest.
"Since Cao Cao has destroyed LiuBei," observed Tian Feng, "the area about Xu city will no longer beundefended.

Not content with this accumulation of high salary and important position, moreover, they also enrich their private households, storing up masses of goods and treasure, embellishing and furbishing their mansions and estates. They take over whole villages and city districts, they steal from the public water supply in order to develop their own fisheries, and their horses and carriages, costumes and adornments, are comparable to those of the imperial house itself.
Some time after this, Cao Cao had occasion to call upon the emperor in his palace. Unable to bear the anxiety, the emperor said to him, "If you can assist me, it would be generous of you. If you cannot, have pity and do not oppress me."
If Liu Zhang has offended you, then I very much regret it. I would not presume to become involved in this matter, but I do ask you to be lenient."
The General of Agile Cavalry Dong Zhong disputed He Jin's authority, and the eunuchs enlisted his aid in support of their party.
Under that system, the excellencies were always responsible for appointments to office, they regularly consulted their subordinates, and they took note of the conduct and abilities of their candidates. Even then, despite such care and consideration, there were still cases where officials failed to fulfil their responsibilities and the administration became weakened.
Both Chinese and non-Chinese peoplewere pleased with this, and none of the refugees that came to live inthis area dared to disobey his teachings.
Sun Ce ordered Taishi Ci to go and settle them, and said to him,"Governor Liu always resented the fact that I attacked Lujiang forYuan Shu.
Guo Tai made skilled judgements of individual moral conduct, but he never engaged in controversial discussion of affairs of state. For this reason, though he lived in turbulent and corrupt times, peril and misfortune did not reach him.
When he came back he asked, "I was pursuing a retreating armywith good soldiers and you said I would suffer a loss. I attacked avictorious army with defeated men and you said that I would win.
The Colonel in Charge of Agriculture Chen Deng of Xiapi replied, "Gonglu is proud and overbearing, not the man to cure disorder.
Since the Day of Assembly was near,I sent in the most important items first.There are some cases where I have not yet made detailed enquiry, but I shall start those investigations as soon as possible.
The province at that time controlled only Jiujiang, but LiuFu rode alone to the empty city of Hefei and set his provincial head quarters there. He called Mei [293] Qian, Lei Xu and the others tojoin him, and they all sent tribute and accepted alliance.
Guo Si heard about this, and said, "For the time being, let him go to a county near here."
"When Yue Yang ate [306] his child, "replied Cheng Ji, "it wasnot because he lacked the feelings of a father for his son, butbecause there were greater principles at stake which forced him toit.
Liu Biao, furious, called him a traitor. Calling a full assemblyof his officials, he drew up soldiers, took his Staff of Authority andintended to execute him.
The Grand Commandant Ma Midi left office. Messengers were immediately sent to appoint Liu Yu, the Governor of You province, as Grand Commandant, and he was enfeoffed as Marquis of Rongqiu.

He ordered him to gatherforces of his own and to act as an ally from the inside.
Xu Zhi was a man from a poor family. He worked in the fields, and would ate only food which he had grown through his own labours. He was respectful and frugal, honest and self-effacing, and all his neighbours admired his virtue. He was frequently invited to take up a post in the offices of the excellencies, but he would never accept.
Zhu Wenming [Zhu Hao] deals with people in good faith. You should warn him to be very careful. "
but what right do you now have to say whetherI live or die?"
From Puban he crossed west of the Yellow River, then formeda protected way to move southwards downstream. [425]
Yuan the Chariots and Cavalry General is bringing his army eastwards, and we cannot be sure of his intentions.
Some ten days later Guan Tong did come to assist Yuan Tan;he left his wife and children behind and they were killed by bandits.
Instead you havesecretly been planning rebellion. This will be a disaster for you, yetyou want me to flatter you for my own interest. Though death maycome, I cannot behave that way."
When Guan Ning was young he was a friend of Hua Xin. On one occasion he was hoeing a vegetable plot with him when they saw gold in the ground. Guan Ning continued hoeing and did not turn to look at it, as if it was nothing but a tile or a stone. Hua Xin took it up, then threw it away. From this people recognised their different qualities.
Liu Bei went back to Yuan Shao's army, but he secretly wanted toget away, so he urged Yuan Shao to make an alliance with Liu Biaoin the south.
Dong Zhuo agreed. He immediately appointed Yuan Shao as Administrator of Bohai, with enfeoffment as Marquis of Kang District.
Here is potential for the government to fell apart.
There are rebels and traitors in alldirections, but what can they do? And why should men like HanXian or Yang Feng be of any concern to you? "Unless you make up your mind to act promptly, however,other strong men will become ambitious, and though you may planit again later, such an opportunity will not repeat itself."
An edict called for the sons and younger brothers of excellencies, ministers and lower officials to be appointed as Gentlemen, replacing eunuchs in attendance at the palace.
Drawing his sword, he turned on Song Zhong, "If I cut your head off now, it would not make me feel any better, and since we shall not see one another again, a man of honour would be ashamed to kill a fellow like you."
Before this, Huang Yun and Jin Wenjing of Hanzhong both relied upon their talents and intelligence, and their names were celebrated far and near, but neither would accept summons to office.
The reason I can face you, and the reason you can deal with me, is because we share a moral code and do not change it.
Zhang Huan and his colleagues bound themselves and reported to the Ministry of Justice. After a few days, they were set free, having each bought remission of sentence by payment of three month's salary.
"At present, any official at your court who wears new clothesand rides in a fine carriage is immediately accused of corruption,while everyone who pays no attention to his appearance and wearsworn-out clothing and furs is considered to be upright and pure.
As your officers, we ask approval to oppose them with the troops we have at hand: within ten days his power will be like fallen earth and flying tiles.
Cai Yong is resentful and seeks harm Liu He."
Du Xi gave peace and encouragement, and over eighty thousand of the people were glad to migrate to Luoyang and Ye.
Because of this, Gongsun Du was pleased at his worth and the people were influenced by his virtue.
Zhang Wen also sent Dong Zhuo forward with thirty thousand men to attack the Xianlian Qiang, but the Qiang and other barbarians from the north surrounded him north of Wangyuan. His supplies were cut off and running low. There was a river crossing nearby, and he built a dam Zhang Wen also sent Dong Zhuo forward with thirty thousand men to attack the Xianlian Qiang, but the Qiang and other barbarians from the north surrounded him north of Wangyuan. His supplies were cut off and running low. There was a river crossing nearby, and he built a dam there as if he planned to catch fish, but instead he quietly moved his army to the other side of the river.
He withdrew his camp to Mianchi and gathered troops at Shan
Lu Su criticised the refusal to hand back the three command- eries. Guan Yu replied, "In the campaign at Wulin the General of the Left fought personally in the ranks, destroying the powerfill and defeating the enemy. Why should he give such toil for nothing, and receive not a single clod of earth? Yet you come and want to take his territory."
In the spring, in the first month Ji Miao and his fellows led a thousand supporters to attack Wang Bi by night. They burnt down his gate and shot Wang Bi in the shoulder.

Ju Shou came to the crossing and sighed, "The master is tooconfident; his servants too ambitious. Oh, Yellow River, distant andtroubling, why do I cross?" He pleaded sick and asked to leave.
"So I now reveal my true feelings, with words from the bottomof my heart.
As they went back, Zu Lang and Taishi Ci rode together in thevan of the army, and all could see the honour that was paid them.
"I wish your majesty might follow the rulers of the past and remove this new law. Let provincial officials be chosen from among those competent to take such appointments, and send them to fill the vacant positions without limitations in terms of months and days nor with the restrictions of [the Law of] Three Relationships. By this means equitable administration will be maintained."
Many disasters and portents appeared at this time.Li Yun of Ganling, who was magistrate of Boma [in Dong commandery], sent in an open memorial, with a copy to the offices of the excellencies, saying, "Liang Ji arrogated power and usurped authority, and his tyranny extendedthroughout the empire. Once the orders had been issued for his arrest and execution, however, the punishment for his crimes was carried out by just a few servants of the [imperial] household. It was not a particularly complex or dangerous affair.Since then, however, enfeoffments have been granted to assorted eunuchs, each valued at ten thousand households or more.Had Emperor Gao heard of this, he would never have approved.
The region of Jiaozhi produced many precious commodities. Over the years many of the Inspectors had been dishonest in their administration, and whenever they had taken enough money they would transfer to another post.The officers and people were angry and made a rebellion. They seized the Inspector, and the Administrator of Hepu Lai Da, and they named [their leader] General Who is Pillar of Heaven.
If we bring an army to attack Li Jue and his fellows, and join with the east of the mountains, we can turn ill fortune into good."
Li Jue was very angry. He was going to kill Zhao Wen, but his younger brother Li Ying opposed it and after some days he gave up the idea.
You were right both times. How did you do it?"
"Once the matter is settled, you can give him a generous fief,and that will avoid any charge of disloyalty. If you do not take himtoday, he will eventually fall to someone else."
The Minister of the Guards Shisun Rui was killed by Li Jue.
Now the local and district officers are taking heavy taxes from them and they are being sent to labour service and are flogged worse than slaves or criminals.
"Moreover, in ancient times when the ruler was taking gentlemen into his service, each feudal lord was required to send one man each year.
If you reject such gift from Heaven, you will be sorry when it is too late."
Now thatI do not ride any more, they have become fat and flabby.
"Qin acted against the true Way. Government was cruel and the people were angry, so when one common fellow gave a single cry their empire was crumbled earth. Gaozu came after this, and he could afford to be generous.
King Cao of WEI recommended Sun Quan to be General of Agile Cavalry, bearing the Staff of Authority as Governor of Jing province, with enfeoffment as Marquis of Nanchang.
Li Shuis sure to ask help from you on false pretences. You hold theposition of an Aheng,

They stopped him outside the doorway and refused to let him see his father.
Yang Xiu told King Cao of WEI about this, but Cao Cao delayed before looking into the accusation.

When the Dowager [her elder sister] died [in 150], the Empress Liang lost favour.

but Guan Yu sealed up everything he had [277] received. Then he wroteto make his excuses and fled to Liu Bei in Yuan Shao's army.
Junior officials will do their best to avert any attack against their superior, just as sons are concerned about their fathers' shame.So [rich men's] carriages have hastened to bring presents, and [poor] men have come on foot carrying their own provisions, and they gather and plot together with men of powerful family, combining in the spread of slander and accusations.Now they claim that I made private agreements with the Qiang, and that I bought them off with cash and goods.

The common fellows who have received their affection and favour are spread throughout the provinces and commanderies, some rise to the rank of the Nine Ministers, and a few have taken position as one of the Three Excellencies.
The salaries of the excellencies, ministers and lesser officials were reduced, and a forced loan was made of half a year's tax income from royal fiefs and marquisates.The noble rank of secondary marquis, together with positions in the Rapid Tiger and Feathered Forest regiments, as Cavalryman Dressed in Red and as Warrior in the Encampments, and also the noble rank Quintuple Grandee, were all offered for sale by inscription, with prices atdifferent levels.
Ju Jun cursed him and said, "You and your fellows have made brutal rebellion. You oppress the emperor, you have brought harm to the highest ministers, and the palace women are scattered abroad.
Guo Si made plans with a member of Li Jue's party, the General of the Household Zhang Bao, for a secret attack,

Guan Yu is brave and fierce, replied LÃ¼ Meng. "It is difficult to match him. He already holds Jing province and he governs with great favour and good faith. Now that he has begun to be successful, his courage and strength are growing. It will not be easy to deal with him."

As the anny was on the march, Sun Quan and his officers were halted north of the Xiaoyao Crossing. Zhang Liao was watching, and when he saw them he led horse and foot in a swift attack.
In the autumn, in the seventh month the Excellency of Works Yang Zi left office. The Minister of Ceremonies Tang Zhen from Yingchuan became Excellency of Works.
At the present time, the General-in-Chief holds the highest position, and his good work has reached its fulfilment; this could become a cause of very great danger. It would be appropriate for him to follow the ceremony of hanging up his carriage; then he could rest soundly on a high pillow.
and we both come from the same district. I would like to speak with you in private to say farewell."
On the following day, he kept the gates of his camp closed, giving his soldiers a rest and waiting to see what would happen. He realised that the enemy would be less keyed-up and ready for him, so during the night he prepared his men for a sortie. At cock-crow they charged the enemy lines, they fought through the [186] morning and into the afternoon, and then they completely defeated the rebels. They cut off Zhang Liang's head and took thirty thousand others, while more than fifty thousand fled to the Yellow River and drowned.
1: 184 AD
On the day renzi [5 Apr] an amnesty was issued for all men of Faction in the empire, and those who had been exiled were allowed to return home. Only Zhang Jue was omitted from the amnesty.
Liu Zhang was by nature tolerant and lenient, he main tained no authority, and when the Dongzhou troops plundered andoppressed the local people he could do nothing to prevent it.
Dong Zhuo's sons, even those still in the arms of maidservants and concubines, were enfeoffed as marquises and played with gold seals and purple ribbons.
Yuan Tan collected his [Yuan Shang's] forces and came back tocamp at Longcou.
Li Gao was extremely frightened. He had planks laid on the floor instead of the usual mats, and he changed the place of his sleeping quarters nine times a night.
though your prowessshook the ground beneath their feet, this is nonetheless the task of asubaltern, not what the commander should be doing.
In the spring, in the second month Duke Cao of WEI returned to Ye.
On the day jihai [16 Feb] the Marquis of Jiedu Village [Liu Hong] came to the Watch-House at the Xia Gate.Dou Wu, bearing the Staff of Authority, was sent with the royal dark-covered chariot to bring him into the palace.
Should we behave like that, our wise scholars andmilitary men will become uncertain and may regret their choice of amaster. Who will remain with you to settle the empire? You mighthave eliminated the threat posed by a single man, but you wouldhave disappointed the hopes of [207] people everywhere. This is acritical decision, and you should think about it carefully.
Once Zhang Lu is defeated then Yi province will bestrong; even if Lord Cao does come there will be nothing he can do.
Zhang Zhao acted as head of the whole administration. Abovehe reported to the court, and below he gave orders to the cities,while the army commanders were all instructed to maintain theirpositions.
He did not dismiss Shen Pei. After this, Shen Pei became friends with Pang Ji.
Chen Gui wanted to send his son Deng to Cao Cao, but LÃ¼ Burefused permission.
Dong Zhuo called a great assembly of the senior officials and said, "Gaozu placed the capital within the passes,and eleven generations later Guangwu set his palace at Luoyang. Now another eleven generations have passed.
At this time Zhou Yu was away on a mission in Poyang, and Lu Su urged Sun Quan to call him back.
Sun Quan had already sent Zhu Ran and Pan Zhang to close every path of escape.
The Palace Attendant Xin Pi, with the Registrar Liu Ye and others at the rear of these troops reported back to Xiahou Dun and Xu Chu that, "Our government troops have taken the chief camps of the enemy, and the rebels are running away."The generals could not believe it,
Then Xu Huang occupied Yancheng, established a line of camps and moved slowly forward.
They took the empress down to the harem jail where she pined away. The two imperial children bom to her were poisoned, and over a hundred of her brothers, cousins and clanspeople also died.
When he was in mourning for his mother he returned to his home and raised a great tomb-mound for her.
Cai Yong of Chenliu, Senior Clerk in the office of the Excellency over the Masses, said: "I had heard that in ancient times there was no ceremony of sacrifice at the tomb,
The various tribes of the Dangjian rebelled once more. Duan Jiong attacked them at Luanjue and completely defeated them, so the Western Qiang were settled.
Qiuliju and his allies were glad to hear that he had come. Each sent messengers and then they all went back home.
Everyone was afraid and pressed Han Song toapologise. Han Song, quite unmoved, replied to Liu Biao slowly andseriously, "It is you who have turned against me; I never turnedfrom you."
Then the emperor became seriously ill and an imperial letter appointed Dong Zhuo as Governor of Bing province, with orders to leave his troops under the command of Huangfu Song.
A plain and upright man, he became bitter at such treatment.Before very long his anger and frustration caused an ulcer to break out, and he died.
saying, "There cannot be two amnesties in a single year."
The Book of Zhou says, 'Fathersand sons, elder and younger brothers, their crimes do not affect one another.' How can you blame Lord Yang for the crimes of Yuan?"
but he had no personal authority and no ability in military planning, so the Qiang made continual incursions and they overran and destroyed camps and defence points.They formed an alliance to attack all the commanderies of the region, and their raids became increasingly destructive.
Those in charge were intimidated, and gave out positions by order of preference:
As Cao Cao brought his army back to Guandu, Yuan Shao nowconsidered an attack on Xu city.
Then another edict made Liu Zhang the Governor of Yi province.Liu Zhang appointed Zhao Wei as General of the Household Who Subdues the East, and he led an army to attack Liu Biao [in Jing province] and camped at Quren.
Yuan Shang doubted him. He did not give Yuan Tan any moremen troops, nor did he change his equipment. Yuan Tan was veryangry.
The emperor said, however, "It was the Dowager who brought me to the throne and entrusted me with the great inheritance. How can I let her end her days as no more than an Honoured Lady?"
Before this, as the capital [Chang'an] and Luoyang were suffering from the disorders of Dong Zhuo their people migrated to the east, and many had come to Xu. As Cao Cao came up, he trapped and killed hundreds of thousands of men and women along the Si River, so many that the water did not flow.
All the officers thought they should accept his plea, but Zhu Jun said, "In warfare, things may look the same but be quite different in reality.
Liu Xun was pleased, and everyone congratulated him, allexcept Liu Ye. Liu Xun asked him why. "Shangliao may be small," he replied, "but the walls are strongand the moat is deep. It is difficult to attack and easy to defend, andit will be at least ten days before we have any hope of taking it.
"Then your majesty accepted the slanders against Cai Yong: you had him suffer punishment, with his family and household, old and young driven far away. Surely this was turning away from a loyal subject!
And brave men are rising everywhere, each with a province or a commandery. They gather followers and collect their forces, and whenever they move they can number their troops by the tens of thousands. This is the time that the Qin have lost a deer, and the first to catch it will rule as king.
but later became hesitant. Zhang Ji was afraid he might change his mind, so he sent orders to the counties to hasten their preparations to receive [Ma Teng], and have the heads of commandery administrations ready to welcome him outside their capitals. Ma Teng had no choice but go to the east.
Xu Rong observed that though Cao Cao had few soldiers under his command, they had maintained the fight all day. He considered an attack on Suanzao would be difficult, and he too drew back.
Some time before this Wang Rui the Inspector of Jing province had accompanied Sun Jian the Administrator of Changsha in an [45] attack on bandits in Lingling and Guiyang. Because Sun Jian held a military appointment, Wang Rui spoke slightingly of him.
On the day xinsi [6 Jul] the General of Chariots and Cavalry Li Jue became Grand Marshal, ranking above the Three Excellencies.
He Yong saw Cao Cao and he sighed and said, "The house of Han is falling, and this is the man who will give peace to the empire."
Sun Quan led a force of seventy thousand to oppose him, andthey faced one another for more than a month.
Yuan Shao's army came to Yangwu. Ju Shou said to him, "Thoughour northern troops are many, their strength and spirit are not equalto the men of the south. The supplies of the southerners are few andtheir stores are not as plentiful as ours of the north.
Cao Cao returned to Ye, and he built the Xuanwu Pond to exercise his fleet.
Zhu Jun climbed a hill of earth to look over the scene, and he turned to his Major Zhang Chao and said, "I have it!
In the twelfth month Cao Cao came back from Anding. He leftXiahou Yuan in camp at Chang'an
the Annals of Emperor Xian.12 February 191 - 31 Jamuary 192
In the sixth month on the day gengren [14 Aug], last of the month,there was an eclipse of the sun.
When Cao Cao first attacked Tao Qian, he was prepared to give his life in the cause. He told his family, "If I do not come back, go and seek refuge with Mengzhuo."
Jia Kui, held out in Jiang. GuoYuan attacked it fiercely, and when the city was about to fall someelders made an agreement with him that they would surrender if hepromised not to harm Jia Kui. Guo Yuan agreed.
Unless I go at once, however, I fear Cao Cao may get there first."
Cui Yan said to his elder brother Sima Lang, "Your young brother has clear intelligence and a keen sense of justice, firm decision and exceptional bravery. You are not so good as that!"
At this time [the territories of] Yuan Shao, Cao Cao andGongsun Zan formed a continuous line. Kung Rong's forces wereweak and he had few supplies, he occupied an isolated corner andhad no communication with any of them.
When the body of Jin Shang was brought to the capital an imperialedict ordered that all officials should attend sacrifices of mourning.Jin Shang's son Wei was appointed a Gentleman of the Palace.
The Assistant OfficerWang Lei of Guanghan hung himself upside down at the gates ofthe capital in protest, but Liu Zhang would not be moved.
but Liu Biao attacked Zhang Yi and also Lingling and Guiyangand conquered all of them.
When Sun Quan showed this to his ministers, they all trembled and turned pale.
I have listened to their suggestions, replied Lu Su, "and those people are misleading you.
And the generals of the northwest must surely be disturbed.
An old friend of Chen Fan, Zhu Zhen of Chenliu, collected Chen Fan's corpse and buried it, and he also gave refuge and concealed his son Chen Yi.The matter was discovered, Zhu Zhen was arrested and imprisoned, and his whole family was put in chains.
In former days, replied Wen Ping, "I failed to assist Liu Jingzhou serve the state. Though Jingzhou is dead, I was still hoping to hold the line of the Han and maintain that territory intact.
If I did as you request, I should be acting like a common fellow, and what would you think of me then?"
The troops in Wei commandery rebelled and joined Poison Yu and the Black Mountain bandits; their combined force numbered several tens of thousands. They stormed Ye city [the capital of Wei commandery] and killed the Administrator.
Liu Kuan, Chancellor of Donghai, was appointed Director of the Imperial Secretariat.
Chen Gong asked to be taken toexecution, and he left without a backward glance. Cao Cao wept forhim. Chen Gong, LÃ¼ Bu and Gao Shun were all killed by strangling,and their heads were sent for display in the market-[238]place at Xucity.
Huan Jie of Changsha, who had been recommended by Sun Jian as Filial and Incorrupt, went to Liu Biao to ask for Sun Jian's body. Liu Biao admired his sense of honour and approved the request.
Liu Tao, a scholar of the University, spoke as follows:"The misfortunes of the present time are not caused by the currency. It is because the people are starving."
Shen Pei and his party were afraid thatYuan Tan would succeed and that Xin Ping and his fellows wouldharm them. So they forged a will of Yuan Shao appointing Shang ashis successor,
"Once you have sent a hostage, you cannot avoid being in closealliance with Cao Cao, and once you are in alliance, you are foreverat his beck and call. So you will be under another man's control,
He was, however, extremely upset when he found out how he had been duped by Cao Jie and the eunuch party. He firmly refused [the fief].
In the spring, in the first month on the day xinmao [18 Feb], first of themonth, there was an eclipse of the sun.
When Liu Biao heard that Liu Bei had arrived he came out from thecity in person to welcome him, treating him as an honoured guest.He added to the number of his troops and sent him to camp atXinye.
In the twelfth month on the day dingsi [7 Jan 179] the Household Counsellor Qiao Xuan became Grand Commandant.
For some time now, I have been in constant ill health, and I fear I may be old and useless, unable to return the grace and kindness you have shown me."I ask that you give me some minor appointment, and let me have just a single carriage to travel to the Three Adjuncts. Then I would display the majestic influence of the nation, and from my experience in warfare and my knowledge of the country Icould give assistance to our armies.
Zhang Wen sent orders by imperial authority to summon Dong Zhuo, but Dong Zhuo delayed a long time before he went. Zhang Wen reprimanded him, but Dong Zhuo answered back.
So he asked him about matters of farming, and then Xu Zhi did respond to him.
He is now very old and quite senile, his treasure and food are in short supply, the men about him are greedy and undisciplined and his officers and soldiers are discontented. His fleet and armaments are damaged, blunted and in disrepair, he pays no attention to farming and his army has neither order nor authority.
"Troops that give aid against rebels and punish oppression,"answered Ju Shou, "they are called loyal. Those that rely onnumbers and trust to their strength, they are called proud.
Our present Emperor, however, is rich in years, and his actions have shown no lack of virtue. There is no parallel with the past."
"Think back," replied Huangfu Li. "The general will surely recall how strong was Dong Zhuo just a short time ago. Lu Bu was his favourite, but then he led a plot against him, and before very long Dong Zhuo's head and body were in different places. That is what happens to men who have adequate courage but fail to make proper plans.
but the Inspector Liang Gu was frightened and thought of killing Su Zhenghe in order to avoid the responsibility [of impeaching such a high official]. He asked the advice of the Chief Clerk of Hanyang, He Xun of Dunhuang. Su Zhenghe had once done He Xun a bad turn,
Fu Jian, a junior officer of the commandery, objected, saying, "This is just a joke among yamen runners,"
Dong Zhuo said again, "In former times, when Huo Guang settled policy, Tian Yannian held the sword.
As a result of this, all the gentlemen of the empire turned with hope to the new administration and looked forward to an era of Great Peace.
The men of Faction lived in an age of confusion and disorder, when all things were out of place and the four seas were in turmoil. They sought to solve problems by the words of their mouths, giving judgements of good and bad as a means to wipe out evil and restore purity. They sought to seize snakes and vipers by the head, and trample the tails of tigers and wolves. But it was they who were injured and wrongfully punished, and the misfortune reached their friends. Men of quality were destroyed, and the nation went on to disaster. The pity of it!
Lu Su urged Sun Quan to lend Jing province to Liu Bei so thatthey could deal with Cao Cao together, and Sun Quan agreed.
Shan Qian the Administrator of Shanyang, , who was younger brother of [the late eunuch] Shan Chao, was arrested and sent to prison for his crimes. Feng Gun, Minister of Justice, examined him and condemned him to death.
Wang Fu had sent some of his attendants to the borders of Jingzhao, where they set up a toll station and collected goods worth more than seventy million cash. The Intendant of Jingzhao, Yang Biao, reported this to the Director of Retainers.
The Gentleman of the Palace Zhang Jun of Zhongshan sent in a memorial, "It is my humble opinion that the reasons Zhang Jue was able to raise troops and make his rebellion, and that the people love him and trust him, are because your ten Regular Attendants have sent family members, relatives and dependents to take control of the provinces."They steal the wealth of the people by cruel taxation and they plunder and rob the poor. The people have no way to tell their grievances, and so they make plans for rebellion and gather together as bandits.
When he arrived, however, the men of his army respected his orders, they did not dare rob or plunder, and no chickens or dogs or vegetables were stolen. Then the people were very pleased, and they hastened to bring cattle and wine as rewards for the army.
Xiahou Yuan turned again to attack Gaoping and the Chuge [group of the Xiongnu].
Then Sima Zhi of Henei was appointed as the new Administrator of Julu. Since he was known to be poor and honest, his fee was reduced to three million cash.
On the day dingsi [20 May] an edict was issued that all non-orthodox local shrines in the commanderies and kingdoms be destroyed. Special exemption was allowed to the two shrines of Wang Huan at Luoyang and of Zhuo Mao in Mi county.
About this time, in the middle of the night there was a red emanation which stretched across the northern sky from east to west. The Court Astronomer sent in a memorial, "There is a secret plot in the north. The emperor should not travel there."
Duan Jiong argued that since it was the time of spring farming the people would be spread across the countryside, and that although the Qiang had made a temporary surrender they would certainly begin their ravages again, for the county offices had no stores of grain. The best policy, therefore, was to take advantage of their present weakness and launch a further attack against them. Their power would surely be smashed.
here is, however, a code of conduct establishedfor rulers and their ministers: just as we share in success or failure,so in all important matters we should take counsel together."
Then Yuan Shao sent troops forward to clear the palace, and a number of them climbed the Principal Gate to attack the inner apartments.
The Bobo bandits ravaged Hedong. Dong Zhuo sent his officer Niu Fu to attack them.
Zhang Song was a man of short stature and erratic conduct, but he had insight and he was shrewd and brave.
Cao Cao sent the Consultant Zhang Ji to go to the west andraise the leaders within the passes, Ma Teng and his fellows. Theybrought troops to attack and destroy Zhang Cheng and his allies. They took the heads of Wei Gu, Zhang Yan and some others, butthe rest of their followers were pardoned. [344]
Then Du Ji governed Hedong, and he was careful to act generouslyand kindly.
We have received your commission to attack and destroy the criminals and we obey your commands. Since we first entered Yingchuan we have been successful in every battle.
When ten years and more had passed, Liang Ji was destroyed, and then Li Xie told the whole story to the keeper of the wine shop.The wine-shop keeper prepared carriages [and baggage] to give him a most generous farewell present, but Li Xie refused to accept.Returning to his native place, he now carried out the mourning ceremonies and put on funeral clothes.When brother and sister met, their sadness touched all who were present.
"Those women in the palace are useless. They crowd the rear apartments, and even if all the people of the empire exhausted their strength in farming and in the manufacture of silk, it would not be enough to keep them supplied.
and the emperor called a general council of excellencies, ministers and court officials to discuss the question.The Consultant Fu Xie spoke most vehemently against the idea, saying, "If only the Excellency over the Masses was executed, all the troubles of the empire would be at an end."
LÃ¼ Meng had Yu Fan, former Commandant of Cavalry, write to Shi Ren [at Gongan], setting out the situation, and Shi Ren promptly surrendered.
From this, the officials recommended that Cheng Jin and Liu Zhi had committed crimes worthy of public execution.
Sun Quan was furious. "I am not going to collect the resourcesof Wu and an army of a hundred thousand men and put them under someone else's orders.
Then the sun went down, and Cao Cao was able to make his retreat.
In the third month on the day xinsi [14 Apr] there was an amnesty for the empire.
Xun You was made Director of the Secretariat, Liang Mao wasDeputy Director, Mao Jie, Cui Yan, Chang Lin, Xu Yi and He Kuibecame Masters of Writing. Wang Can, Du Xi, Wei Ji and He Xiabecame Palace Attendants. Zhong Yao became Grand Judge, Wang Xiu became Ministerof Finance, Yuan Huan became Prefect of the Gentlemen of thePalace acting as Royal Counsellor, and Chen Qun became PalaceAssistant Imperial Clerk.
An imperial edict called Zhang Huan to become Minister of Finance, and Huangfu Gui was again appointed as General on the Liao to replace him.
"Go away, Kongzhang [Chen Lin]! Seek advantage where you will. I, Zang Hong, devote my life to personal loyalty. You follow the leader of the alliance [Yuan Shao], I serve [the emperor at] Chang'an."You say I shall die and my name will be lost. But I can laugh at you, who must live in ignominy."
At first, they could still find rats, old bones and sinews, but then there was nothing that could be cooked and eaten.
harnessing two enemies against each other, we sit and wait until they are weakened.
Later, when the Faction affair broke out, Yuan Hong intended to hide in the depths of the forests. Because of his old mother, however, he did not feel that he could go so far away. So he had a square building of earth constructed in the courtyard [of the family home], with no door, but a window through which food could be sent in.
Zhang Jian made his escape, in desperate straits. He sought refuge from house to house, and at each place, recognising his reputation and conduct, people endangered themselves in order to offer him assistance.
Lu Xun came to Lukou, and he wrote to Guan Yu praising hisachievements. He was humble and restrained and sounded utterlyreliable and loyal.
Now that the emperor had destroyed Liang Ji, he was able to take account of old favours and private friendships, and he awarded a number of enfeoffments and titles.He gave posthumous appointment as General of Chariots and Cavalry to the empress' father Deng Xiang, with enfeoffment as Marquis of Anyang.He changed the fief of the empress' mother, the Lady Xuan, to be Lady of Kunyang, while Deng Kang and Deng Bing, sons of the empress' elder brother, both became marquises.Other members of the family became colonels, or generalsof the household, and were given enormous rewards and presents, calculated by the tens of thousands.
In the spring, in the first month on the day jiayin [19 Feb], first of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.
Recognising the truth of this, Cao Cao strengthened hisdefences and held on.
Then he turned back and defeated Liu Bei east of Tan.
LÃ¼ Bu was afraid Yuan Shu would not send help because hisdaughter had failed to arrive. Wrapping the girl in silk and tying herto a horse, he escorted her out of the city by night. They met withCao Cao's guards, who shot arrows at them. The party could not getthrough, and so came back to the city.
When the army returned [to Chang'an], Li Li reported to Li Jue that "Han Sui and Fan Chou met on horse back and spoke together. I do not know what they said, but it looked friendly and was all very private."
Yuan Shao gathered his chieftains to see Zang Hong, and said, "Zang Hong, how could you be so ungrateful?
Which is the right one?"
In the summer, in the fourth month Zhang Yen, leader of the BlackMountain bandits, brought his forces to surrender, more than ahundred thousand men.8 He was made Marquis of Anguo Village.
Cao Cao sent Zhang Liao and Guan Yu to go ahead and beginthe attack.
Liu Zhang led more than thirty thousand horsemen and foot soldiers, with chariots and canopies brilliant as the sun, to meet him.
He then urged his soldiers to goquickly to the head of the pass, joined the Boshui troops to his own,and went forward to seize the city of Fu.
Han Fu was a timid man, and agreed.
and Liu Bei sent Zhang Fei, as Administrator of Baxi, to fece him. After almost two months Zhang Fei caught Zhang He with a surprise attack and thoroughly defeated him.
Before this, Sun Jun the Administrator of Anding had been greedy and avaricious;the Commandant of the Dependent State [of Anding] and the Imperial Clerk Commanding the Army, Li Xi and Zhang Bing, had each killed great numbers of Qiang people when they came to surrender;while Guo Hong the Inspector of Liang province and Zhao Xi the Administrator of Hanyang were old and feeble and could not cope with their responsibilities.Relying upon the power and honour of their positions, none paid any attention to the law or to proper principle.
Dong Zhao of Dingtao [in Jiyin commandery] said to Zhang Yang, "Though Yuan Shao and Cao Cao are allies, they will not stay together for long.
The emperor is an exile, and you were among thefirst to call up loyal troops. The east of the mountains has beendisturbed and disordered, and that is the only reason you have hadno opportunity to come to his aid.
Lu Su wrote to Liu Bei, "Pang Shiyuan is not the man tomanage a hundred li,
"How can my administration have been worthy of such kind words?" replied Liu Chong.
Li Jue and Guo Si received Cao Cao's envoy, but they were convinced that the rebels east of the passes wanted to set up their own emperor, and although Cao Cao had sent for orders they were sure there was some trick. They considered keeping Cao Cao's messenger back.
but Jia Xu stood over Zhang Xiu as he sat and said openly to YuanShao's messenger, "Go back and present our apologies to YuanBenchu. If he could not remain on good terms with his own cousin,how can he cope with the leaders of the empire?"
Man Chong the Administrator of Runan said, "The mountainwaters came swiftly, and we can hope they will go down just as fast.
About this time [i.e. in the fifth month] there appeared the portent of an eclipse.Chen Fan said to Dou Wu, "In former times Xiao Wangzhi was put into distress by the one fellow Shi Xian.The situation will be still more difficult when you have to deal with scores of Shi Xians!
Lii Meng welcomed him and took his hand and they went down into a boat together. When they had finished their conference,Lii Meng took out the letter and showed it to him, clapping his hands and roaring with laughter.
The Lady Xuan ran to the palace and told the emperor, and the emperor was furious.Then the emperor went to the lavatory, and he spoke there alone with Tang Heng, Secretarial Attendant of the Yellow Gates,asking him, "Which among my attendants are on bad terms with the consort family?"
They are forced to give their wives to others and to sell their children, and some even cut their own throats. They have complained of the suffering and injustice to their commandery and provincial offices, but the administrators neither forward their petitions nor do anything to help them. They are far from the court and their voice is unheard. They sigh and groan but find no one to grant them redress.
Cao Cao called in Chen Gong's mother and looked after her tothe end of her life. He arranged marriage for Chen Gong's daughterand cared for his family, treating them in all respects even moregenerously than before.
At this time the General Who Subdues the South Cao Ren was camped at Fan guarding Jing province. King Cao of WEI ordered him to go back and attack Hou Yin.
Liang Ji himself usurped power and authority, while his evil and excessive behaviour grew worse every day.He set his own relatives and clients in the close positions of the palace guard, so he knew all details of everything that happened in the private apartments.
At this time, the Regular Attendants Zhao Zhong, Zhang Rang, Xia Yun, Guo Sheng, Duan Gui and Song Dian had all been enfeoffed and treated with great favour. The emperor would often say, "Regular Attendant Zhang Rang is my father and Regular Attendant Zhao Zhong is my mother."
What you can do, however, is establish a position south of the Yellow River and wait to see what happens."
In the autumn, in the seventh month a special sacrifice was held to pray for rain in the capital district.
Soon afterwards the Black Mountain bandits Poison Yu, Bo Rao, Sui Gu and their followers, over a hundred thousand strong, plundered in Dong commandery,and Wang Gong could not keep them out.
In the third month Wang Zheng, a retainer of Zhang Chun, killed Zhang Chun and sent his head to Liu Yu.
The Wuhu barbarians of Jiaozhi had long been making trouble, and the provincial and commandery authorities could do nothing to control them.
Then his uncle Sun Jing [his father's youngerbrother] said to him, "Wang Lang holds the town defences, and it isdifficult to storm them quickly.
The advance guard, however, got lost in the dark, and came by mistake upon one of Zhang Wei's pickets. In the confusion, the defenders scattered and fled.
In the fifth month He Jin presented a memorial jointly with the Three Excellencies, "The Xiao-Ren Empress [the Dowager Dong] instructed the former Regular Attendant Xia Yun and others to advise provincial and commandery governments to send the proceeds of all taxes to the Western Apartments.
Before this, opinion at court had been concerned that personal feelings might create factional connections in provinces and commanderies. As a result there was a regulation that where there was a marriage relationship between gentlemen of two provinces, neither should be permitted to act as supervisor in the other's home territory. In addition, there was established the Law of the Three Relationships. As the restrictions were applied very strictly, it became extremely difficult to recruit men for positions, and in You and Ji provinces there had been unfilled vacancies for a considerable length of time.
On the day jiawu [19 Oct] the Governor of Yu province Huang Wan was made Excellency over the Masses.
Yuan Shao fled to the north bank [of the Yellow River] by Liyangand went to the camp of his General Jiang Yiqu. He took him by thehand and said, "
Such tactics, argued Guo Huai, "will only show weakness, and will not give us a sufficiently strong position against the enemy. This is not a good plan.
Zuo Guan and Tang Heng were also appointed Regular Attendants.
and he sent Kuai Yue to trick the clan leaders to come to him. Fifty-five men arrived, and they were all beheaded and their followers taken over.
You should permit the return of his family and dependents, and you should release the bonds of proscription.Now the chief ministers are extremely important, and the fortunes of the state depend upon them. Among the four excellencies at the present time, only the Excellency of Works Liu Chong is completely honest and worthy.All the rest of them are false, men who encourage rebellion and who draw their stipend without working for it. Inevitably,they 'break the tripod of the cauldron and overturn the gruel'.They should be dismissed on account of the ill omens. If you summon the former Excellency of Works Wang Chang, and the Steward of the Palace of Prolonged Joy Li Ying, they are both worthy to guide the affairs of state, and this medley of disasters and dangers will cease. The prosperity of the state may be established for a long time to come.
Liu Bei plundered between the Ru and the Ying. The people southof Xu city were unsettled and Cao Cao was concerned about it.
Li Jue often invited Guo Si to drink, and sometimes kept him to stay overnight.
In the autumn, in the eighth month Cao Cao attacked Liu Biao, andhis army came to Xiping.
"The lands east of the Yangzi have security from mountains andrivers," replied Dong Xi,
Why have you come so late? asked Cao Cao.
When Zhang Lu fled to the territory of Ba, Huang Quan said to Liu Bei? Once we lose Hanzhong, the Three Ba will be in danger, and this would cut away the rump and the back of SHU.
"while the government and virtue of theGeneral Who Exterminates Rebels [Sun Ce] have already attractedthe people. The General Who Exterminates Caitiffs [Sun Quan] canbuild on these foundations, so that great and small follow hiscommands. Zhang Zhao can look after affairs of government, whileothers like me act as claws and teeth. With strategic advantage andsupport from the people, there is surely no cause for concern."
An edict said, "How can I contemplate the choice of my harem when the burial place for my late mother has still not been decided?"
I intend to make a new start and seek another master. Whydon't you come too?" "The Yuan have shown favour and generosity to all the world,"replied his colleagues, "and many men turn to them. Furthermore,[Yuan Shao] is very powerful now, and where can we go if we leavehim?" Guo Jia realised that they would never understand, and he leftwithout saying more.
Liang Ji, however, found out the deception.He hunted for Yuan Zhu, caught him, and had him flogged to death.
Yuan Shao had attacked Gongsun Zan for several years but had notbeen able to defeat him. He wrote a letter to Gongsun Zansuggesting that they end their quarrel and make peace.
Zhu Zhen was most brutally tortured, but he preferred to meet death rather than speak, and so Chen Yi was able to escape.
The Yellow Turbans of Qing province ravaged Bohai with a force of three hundred thousand men, and they planned to join forces with the Black Mountain bandits.
In the summer, in the fourth month on the day guihai [?], there was an amnesty for the empire.
Yan Liang and Wen Chou haveonly the bravery of common fellows. One battle will be enough todeal with them."
Since the time of the Yongchu period [107-113], many military commanders have been sent out on campaign, and five armies have been completely defeated.26 The cost has been counted in the billions, and the supply carts that were brought back [laden with treasure] have been sealed up intact and taken into the houses of the great families.Those generals nonetheless achieved a reputation, they were respected for their good work, and they were granted generous rewards and enfeoffments.
The rift gradually widened between them so that Ganling was divided between "north" and "south". The criticisms made by the men of faction [at the capital in later years] had their origins in this.
On the day yichou [13 Jun?]there was a fire at the eastern tower of Gongling [the tomb of Emperor An].
4: 187 AD
So LÃ¼ Meng entered Jiangling. Releasing Yu Jin, he captured the families and dependants of Guan Yu and his men. He comforted and looked after them, giving orders to his army that there should be "No plundering of private houses."
His Registrar Yang Xiu suggested he offer Zhang Song a new appointment, but Cao Cao would not agree.So Zhang Song was angry. He went back and urged Liu Zhang to break with Cao Cao and ally with Liu Bei. Liu Zhang followed his advice.
They replied, "People who form cliques are men of Faction."
and his affection for Zhuge Liang became closer every day.
They jointly recommended that Cao Caoshould be named General Who Maintains the East in Peace, and thathe succeed his father as Marquis of Bi Village.
Liu Zhang sent his officers Liu Gui, Leng Bao, Zhang Ren,Deng Xian, Wu Yi and others to oppose Liu Bei.14 They were alldefeated and came back to hold Mianzhu,15 while Wu Yi went toLiu Bei's camp to surrender.
By reason of her teachings about demons and spirits, Zhang Lu's mother was a frequent visitor at Liu Yan's house.Liu Yan appointed Zhang Lu as Major Who Controls Righteousness and Zhang Xiu as a Senior Major. The two men joined forces to surprise and kill Su Gu the Administrator of Hanzhong, and to block the Yegu Pass, and they killed the messengers from the Han court.
In the spring, in the first month on the day guizhou [7 Feb] there was an amnesty for the empire.
Before this, Liu Bei of Zhuo commandery was a descendant of the Tranquil King of Zhongshan.
"If a man does not fear death, you cannot awe him withpunishments, and if a man does not love life, you cannot encouragehim with good treatment.
If the sage court undertakes self-denial, then your attendants and close ministers will also be influenced and changed, the people will contain their demands, and there will be an end to misfortunes and omens. It is the Way of Heaven to punish the arrogant, but the gods and spirits reward modesty.
Believing that the reliefforce had arrived, Gongsun Zan came out to fight.
Dong Zhuo now sent the General of the Household of the East Dong Yue to camp at Mianchi, the General of the Household Duan Wei to camp at Huayin, and the General of the Household Niu Fu to camp at Anyi. His other commanders were spread out among the counties to block any attack from the east of the mountains.
He pushednorth against Tian Kai, and in the east he defeated Kong Rong. Hewas respected and honoured far and wide.
Jing province was divided, with the Xiang River as the border: Changsha, Jiangxia, and Guiyang to the east were under Sun Quan, while Nan commandery, Lingling and Wuling to the west remained with Liu Bei.
His officersasked why, and he explained. "The land within the passes is verybroad. If each group of rebels kept to the difficult country and madeus attack him, it would take more than two years to settle them.
Zhang Hong had no thought but to give help inthe supervision and to make sure everything was done correctly.
If you raise an army and attack, you will surely defeat them. When you have done that, encourage farming and build stores of grain, look for some grievance and await opportunity. At best, you will overturn the enemy and preserve the royal house; at a second level, you may nibble away at Yong and Liang provinces and so extend your territory; and at the very least, you can set firm guard on the strategic points and secure yourself a long time to come.
Now if you can indeed order your brave commanders to take twenty or thirty thousand men, to join with Yuzhou and ally our forces, then Cao Cao's army will certainly be destroyed.
Following this, the Director of Retainers Han Yan sent in memorials on the crimes and wrongdoing of Zuo Guan. In addition, he called evidence from their native province and commandery that [Zuo Guan's] elder brother, the Minister Coachman and Marquis of Nan District Zuo Cheng,18 had accepted and offered special favours and had taken bribes and received contributions for wrongful purposes. Their retainers, moreover, had acted lawlessly and had bullied and abused the local officials and the common people.
Accepting this argument, Cao Cao sent a messenger to Zhang Yang, Administrator of Henei, asking him to open the road west to Chang'an. Zhang Yang refused.
It was my intention to take Xu province first, and then deal with Guan Yu, replied Sun Quan. "What about that?"
replied Sun Ce, "as a gentleman of family you have numbers of men under your command, and you have already made a reputation for yourself on campaign. Why should you accept such a low appointment and to attend the petty details of my army?"
Now Ji province is an important property of the empire. If he and Gongsun Zan join forces to seize it then danger and loss can be expected any moment.
Yuan Shao, through He Jin's trusted client Zhang Jin, urged him to kill all the eunuch officials.
In the spring, one of Zhang Jue's disciples, Tang Zhou of Ji'nan,1 sent a message to the court telling of the plot.
"But since the moment Your Excellency alighted from your carriage, the dogs no longer bark at night, and the people never see an official. At last, in our old age, we have had the fortune to experience your sage-like understanding; andnow we hear that we must lose you. For this reason, we offer you a gift in parting."
The emperor was still in the outer court receiving Chi Lii in audience when the empress, with her hair dishevelled, barefoot and weeping, passed by and said farewell, "Can you not save me this once?"
All the excellencies, and more than three hundred university students led by Zhang Feng, came to the palace gates to petition for him.Soon afterwards there was an amnesty and he returned to his home.
He respected and honoured the famous scholar Zheng Xuan,treated him with the courtesy owed by a son or grandson, andchanged the name of his village to "Village of Lord Zheng."
On the day yisi [24 Nov] some Yellow Turbans killed [Liu] Yun, King of Ji'nan.
"Your majesty should take action to remove any opportunities for your eunuch attendants to be involved in government. You should call in the officers of your secretariat and your court, to appoint and promote only those who are pure and of high moral quality, and to criticise and eliminate those who are wicked and base.
Chunyu Shi informed against you, remarked Sun Quan, "yet you recommend him. Why?"
Then he sent a detachment of seven thousand under the command of Tian Yan, Xia Yu and other officers, all with gags in their mouths, on a night march to climb the mountains on the west [of the valley], where they set camps and dug ditches about one li from the enemy. And he also sent the Major Zhang Kai and others, with three thousand men, to climb the mountains to the east.
His heart is loyal and honest, and he does not give hisword lightly. Once he has entrusted himself to a real friend, he willnot go back on the promise while he lives. There is no cause forconcern."
As Xiahou Dun was about to leave, he made one final attempt, but Tian Chou replied, "I am a man who turned from his honour and ran away like a rat. To receive the favour of life, that is great good fortune. I did not sell information about the Lulong road to get an easy reward and a salary.
Li Jue and the others wanted all their proteges to receive appointment, and if anyone objected they were prompt to show their feelings.
Cao Cao had intended to give his daughter in marriage to Ding Yi, but because Ding Yi had only one eye, Cao Pi objected and prevented it.
Cao Cao spoke with his ministers, and all agreed he should keep it secret.
The court heard that there was trouble in Yi province.
Jia Xu had made a name for himself in the past and had beenpopular with Duan Wei's army, so Duan Wei received him well.
Returning to the attack, Cao Cao took Dingtao, then sent detachments to settle the other counties [of Yan province].
"You are facing him alone with an isolated army," observed XuYou. "There can be no help from outside and your supplies arealready exhausted. This is a critical situation.
Liu Bei remained in Jing province for several years. On oneoccasion that he was in attendance upon Liu Biao he got up to go tothe lavatory, and as he came back he was weeping.
Unless your majesty hastens to execute the members of this group, there will certainly be turmoil and change. The nation and state itself is under threat from an immeasurable misfortune.
Cao Cao's men all came out from their camps to stand and look, and they pointed and said that Huang Gai was coming to surrender.
Gongsun Zan knew that Yuan Shu had ideas of rebellion and urged Liu Yu not to send troops, but Liu Yu would not agree.
On that very day,however, Guo Tai was at the academy. Zuo Yuan remembered what had been said to him before and felt ashamed of himself. So he gave up his plan and went away.
Since the moment I came here, however, I have heard no praise for any good man, but on the contrary you give support to the wrong-doers.This is not the sort of request I had hoped to hear from you."
In the spring, in the first month on the day dingchou [?] there was an amnesty for the empire.
Yuan Shao made his son Tan Inspector of Qing province. Tian Kai fought him but without success.
5: 176 AD
The emperor's close attendants slandered Lu Kang, saying that he was comparing the sacred government of the emperor with the ruined states of the past; Great Iniquity. A cage-cart was sent to bring him to the Ministry of Justice.
In the fifth month on the day gengshen [13 Jul] there was a fire in the offices of the Palace of Perpetual Joy.
I have heard it said that when a farmer removes weeds, good grain is sure to flourish;and if loyal ministers remove evil, then the royal way will be made clear.
Duan Jiong made wide-ranging and energetic investigation, and he arrested over a thousand students of the Imperial University, lodging at Luoyang, who were implicated in the affair.
yet I have heard that Deng Zun, father of the Intendant of Henan Deng Wanshi,has been granted posthumous honours for very minor achievements,and the broken inheritance of the fief once held by the ancestors of the Director of the Secretariat Huang Jun is now being restored.
Before this, there was a children's song which ran,Yan comes down to the south, Zhao extends to the north; The gap between them, just the size of a millstone; Only there can you take refuge from the world."
An edict ordered the Palace Attendants and the Masters of Writing to proclaim to Yang Ding and his fellows that they should make peace with Duan Wei. Yang Ding and the others accepted the command and went back to their camps.
If you take infantry and cavalry and make campoutside, I shall take command of the rest of the army and hold fastinside the city.
"In my humble opinion, all those women who have not received imperial favour should be sent out from the palace to be married. That would be the greatest good fortune for the state."
Later, however, a stupid ruler receives the inheritance. He sees that no-one in the empire dares oppose him, and he believes himself secure as Heaven and Earth.
"When King Wu [of Zhou] attacked Zhou [of Shang]," repliedGuo Tu and Shen Pei, "that was not disloyalty.
Ba Su said, "If a man is the servant of another, when he makes plans he does not dare to keep them secret from him, and when there is fault he does not seek to avoid punishment. Since I did not keep [my association with] Dou Wu's plans a secret, how can I dare to avoid his punishment?"
The Gentleman of the Palace, Yuan Zhu of Runan, who was aged nineteen, went to the palace gates and sent in a letter which said, "Like the cycle of the four seasons, good work comes to its fulfilment and then declines,and it is rare that high rank and great favour do not bring misfortune [upon those who hold them too long].
So Cao Cao sent him into the city to proclaim to the people thatthey should all carry on business as usual, without any disturbance.The city was quiet.
Yuan Shu sent Han Yin as envoy to LÃ¼ Bu, explaining his imperialclaim and asking for the marriage alliance. LÃ¼ Bu agreed to send hisdaughter back with him.
Sun Jian, Adviser to the Army, said to Zhou Shen, "The enemy have no supplies of grain in the city and they will have to collect it from outside. Let me have ten thousand men and I can cut their supply routes. If you, my general, follow with the main body of the army, the enemy will be in distress and will not dare to fight. They will run away to the Qiang; then we can join forces to attack them and all Liang province will be settled."
In the autumn, in the seventh month Duan Jiong came to Jingyang, and the remaining bandits, some four thousand groups, scattered among the hills and valleys of Hanyang.
And at the same time,Magistrate Zhang, with all the wealth of Chenliu, is just waiting for an occasion to make rebellion. If we are to avoid complications, I believe we should leave this territory. What do you say?"
Zhang Xiu of Ba commandery had cured people's sickness by magical tricks, and his teaching was in many respects like that of Zhang Jue. He ordered families where there was sickness to offer up five dou of rice, and he was called the Five Dou of Rice Teacher.
As the ministers followed the imperial carriage on foot, the soldiers went immediately into the palace, plundered the place and seized all the women.
Angry and frightened, Zhang He joined with Gao Lan to burnthe engines of attack, and they went to Cao Cao's camp to surrender.
The Court Architect Kong Rong heard of this. Not even takingthe time to put on court dress, he went to Cao Cao and said, "TheYang family has shown virtue over four generations, and isrespected within all the four seas.
And so, though government was corrupted Custom was not indecline. Those officials and scholars went forward to face the axe and the halberd, and even when the first of them was killed, their example of loyalty and honour was so great that others followed in their footsteps on the road to execution. They saw death as the necessary and natural path.
The following morning, however, MaChao's soldiers saw his tracks, and they chased him and caught him.
Xin Ping's family had been held in the prison at Ye. Xin Pi rodethere at once to get them out, but Shen Pei had already had themkilled.
The best thing to do is leave the baggage behind and make a forced march with light troops. That way, you take them by surprise."
His younger cousin Cao Hong gave his horse to Cao Cao, but Cao Cao would not accept.
Yuan Shao and Tian Kai, the Inspector of Qing province appointed by Gongsun Zan, had been fighting continuously for two years. Both sides were exhausted, their supplies were finished, and they had plundered each other's people until the land was a wilderness without a single blade of grass.
As more enemy horsemen gradually came up, Sun Jian calmly left his seat and led his men back into the city. Then he explained, "The reason I did not get up straight away was that I was afraid the soldiers would rush and trample one another, and you would not be able to get in."
On the day guichou [?] the Honoured Lady Song was established as Empress.She was the daughter of the Bearer of the Mace Song Feng.
The scene was repeated three times, and Wei Zhao showed no signs of resentment or dismay.
Then I heard that my native province had been invaded and the leader [180] of my commandery was in danger. I asked for an army and was refused. I asked to go myself, but I was kept back. And now my former lord has come to harm."My sincerity has been denied its true expression, and how can I return to the path of amity? Should I do so, I would inflict still greater harm to my sullied name for filial piety and loyalty. This is the reason I must endure my grief and wave a weapon in farewell, hold back my tears and end our relationship.
"If Cui Lie failed to realise the consequences of his policy, he is a fool. If he knows what he is saying, he is a traitor."
In the enclosure [at Mei] there were twenty or thirty thousand catties of gold, eighty or ninety thousand catties of silver, with brocade, fine silk and rare ornaments piled up into mounds and hills.
Zuo Chengzu urged himto trust himself to some more powerful state [Cao Cao or YuanShao], but Kong Rong would not hear of it, and he killed him. LiuYixun left.
The army then turned against Huaili, and Chong Shao and the others were all killed.
So the mob of mean men gained what they wished, and the scholars and gentlemen all lost heart.
Having completed his studies, Qiu Xiang returned to his native village. When he was home, he was always [50] dressed in formal clothes, and his wife and children served him as they would the sternest of rulers.
In the spring, in the first month Cao Cao attacked Nanpi.1 Yuan Tancame out to fight and casualties were high.
Du Shang was afraid he would be blamed [for not having destroyed the rebellion completely in the earlier stage of the campaign], so he sent in a false report that some bandits from Cangwu had entered his territory. As a result, an imperial edict ordered Zhang Pan to report to the Ministry of Justice.
Chen Shi, former magistrate of Taiqiu, died. More than thirty thousand men came from every part of the empire to attend his funeral.
Yuan Shang's officers LÃ¼ Kuang and Gao Xiang rebelled andturned to Cao Cao, but then Yuan Tan had generals' seals [323]carved in secret and sent to them.
When Guan Yu saw those camps in danger, he took five thousand horse and foot to support them. Xu Huang attacked and put them to flight.
Yuan Shu was by the Yangzi and the Huai, andhis soldiers took clams and mussels. Many turned to cannibalism,and all the country was abandoned and desolate.
and Cao Cao replied, "That man on the bay horse riding away."
"Lord Cao is brave and foresighted, he seizes opportunitieswithout hesitation. His rules are consistent, his soldiers are welltrained, he can appreciate exceptional men, and every one that heappoints will give all his effort to serve him. He is the man to carryout great plans."
Later, Cao Cao seized Liu Zong's power and boasted how he would lead hundreds of thousands of sailors and soldiers together down the river. When I asked my officers for advice, not one of them had anything to suggest, while Zhang Zibu [Zhang Zhao] and Qin Wenbiao [Qin Song] both said that we should send tribute and receive Cao Cao.
So the king made excuses to themessengers from Liaodong, and he disbanded the cavalry that hehad prepared for Yuan Tan.
But at the present time official positions are mistaken and confused, petty men gain advancement through flattery;wealth and property are publicly misused, and the authority of the government declines further every day.When the documents [of imperial decrees] one foot long are issued without proper care,this shows that the emperor does not want to act as a judge!"
The Palace Attendant Xiang Xu of Henei sent in a memorandum criticising the emperor's close attendants.
The emperor made no further reply, but turned to Zhang Rang and said, "Your brother was a criminal. What did the Director of Retainers do that was wrong?" And he sent him away.
In the winter, in the tenth month the Colonel of Garrison Cavalry Yuan Feng became Excellency of Works.
Wang Lang of Donghai, Headquarters Officer in Xu province, and the Attendant Officer Zhao Yu of Langye suggested to their Inspector Tao Qian, "If you wish to be numbered amongst the feudal lords, the best method is to show loyalty to the throne.Now that the Son of Heaven is away in the western capital you should send a messenger to take tribute.
It was the gentle government of the Ancient Duke and the Lord of the West that attracted all the empire;would they have needed to send carts laden with gold, and carriages of treasure, as a favour to the people?
He agreed to accept just one large coin from each of them.
He Qi led three thousand men to the southern bank to meet Sun Quan, and so he made his escape.
He recommended Cheng Yu as Chancellor of Dongping to command the garrison at Fan.
In my humble opinion, however, it is not yet possible to make comparison with the Grand Duke. It would be better to wait until the east of the passes is settled and at peace, and the emperor is returned to his former capital [at Luoyang]. Then we can talk about it.
When Han established Flying Swallow [Zhao Feiyan] the succession and the sacrifices were broken and ended.
Li Jue wanted to make an alliance with Yuan Shu, so he appointed him General of the Left and enfeoffed him as Marquis of Yangdi, granting him the Staff of Authority.
When Yang Fu saw Jiang Xu and his mother, he wept in anextremity of grief. "Why this?" asked Jiang Xu.
Tian Chou told him, "This road is always flooded in autumn and summer. Too deep for carts or horses but too shallow for boats, it has long been a problem.
"This commandery is the seat of an ancient capital, and it lies within the inmost regions of the empire.39 The tombs and funerary parks [of the dynasty] have their origins at Zhangling, and three empresses have been born at Xinye.40 Since the time of the restoration of Han, worthy ministers, generals and chancellors have emerged from here, one generation after another.
From that point all was well-ordered and none of the entourage dared to extort supplies or give any further trouble to the local officials.
He immediately hadthe Master of Writing Feng Shi and two other men executed aspunishment for crimes. He enfeoffed the General of the GuardsDong Cheng and twelve others as full marquises as reward for theirgood work, and he gave posthumous title as Administrator ofHongnong to the Colonel of the Archers Who Shoot at a Sound JuJun, in recognition of his honourable death.
and Zhou Yu crossed the Yangzi and camped on the northern bank to oppose Cao Ren directly.
When the bandits to the south heard about this, they came of their own accord to offer submission.
Gongsun Zan believed this referred to the territory of Yi, so he transferred his headquarters there. He had ten moats [184] dug around, and within the moats he built motte fortresses, each fifty or sixty feet high, and on top of these he put towers. The mound within the central moat was a hundred feet high, and that was where he lived himself.
The Inspector of Yu province, Guo Gong, brought an army of several ten thousand men below the walls of [Juancheng] city. Some said that he was in the plan with Lu Bu, and everyone was afraid.
If you quietly turn the army about, however, and go from the mouth of Lulong to the narrow gorges of Botan, you emerge onto open ground. The road is close by and easy to reach. You can take them unawares and Tadun will be caught without a fight."
"When the Director of the Secretariat Chen Fan has authority in the manage-ment of affairs," explained Yuan Yan, "then there is good government. When the Regular Attendants and Yellow Gates officials are allowed to take part in administration, then there is disorder.
At the instigation of Cen Zhi [the Officer of Merit in Nanyang] and the Officer for Criminals Zhang Mu, Cheng Jin arrested Zhang Fan and his associates.
Liu Meng, however, considered that the criticisms were justified, and was reluctant to pursue the matter.
Cai Mao and Zhang Yun were afraid that if he saw Liu Biao, the father and son would be reunited, and Liu Biao would change his mind about the succession. So they said to Liu Qi, "The General has ordered you to look after Jiangxia, and that is a most important post. Now you have left your people and come back without permission.
Cao Cao's supplies were also exhausted, and he led his men back.
Han Fu is a very ordinary fellow, argued Pang Ji. "If we make a secret agreement with Gongsun Zan to have him take Ji province, Han Fu will certainly be startled and frightened. Then you send someone who can argue a case well, to explain things to him. Han Fu will be under pressure, he will become flustered and he will certainly be willing to yield."
In the second month, on the day renzi [2 Apr], the last of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.
Now if Zhang Huan has been dragging his feet and delayed going forward, that is because he is concerned that though [the barbarians] may appear to be divided, they are in fact united.If that was the case, there would be trouble everywhere as soon as his soldiers made a move.
Liu Yao then sent his officers Fan Neng and Yu Mi to camp at Hengjiang, and Zhang Ying at Danglikou, to hold them off.
So he travelled to the commandery in a single carriage, and the Shanyu were surprised and pleased.
Every official, from inspectors and administrators down to Abundant Talent and Filial and Incorrupt candidates, whenever they were appointed or promoted, had to contribute cash for army funds or for the repair of the palace buildings. A man appointed to a large commandery had to pay twenty or thirty million cash, and smaller commanderies were in proportion. Those due to be given office had first to go to the Western Garden and negotiate a price before they could take up their posts. The more honest of them begged not to go, but all were compelled to do so.
Pang Degong once described Kongming [Zhuge Liang] as a dragon dormant, Shiyuan [Pang Tong] as a young phoenix, and Decao [Sima Hui] as a mirror of water. That is why Sima Hui used those terms when he described the two men to Liu Bei.
Sun Quan approved, and he restored Xi Su's troops to him.
We should make it easy [437] for themto surrender by showing authority and fair dealing. To run away intothe wilderness merely shows weakness."
The baggage from Boma was still on the road, and the officersthought that since there were so many enemy horsemen it would bebetter to go back and guard the camp.
Yuan Shu now allocated Sun Ce about a thousand of Sun Jian's old soldiers, and recommended him as Colonel Who Cherishes Righteousness.
So LÃ¼ Bu gave up the idea, and he secretly sent his secretariesXu Si and Wang Kai to ask help from Yuan Shu.
Sun Quan, very startled, could not think what to do, but ran to a high mound and defended himself with a long lance.
Cao Cao was angry and said, "Whenthey are behind our backs, then tell me."
When Cao Cao heard that Sun Ce had died, he thought to take theopportunity to attack.
but the king said, "My inform ants claim not only that Mao Jie criticised me, but that he expressed sympathy for Cui Yen.
Hassled forward by horsemen and foot- soldiers, they trod one another down in the turmoil. Starving and hungry they scavenged and robbed. Piled-up corpses clogged the roads.
Before this, when the Protector of the Army of the Right Jiang Qin was stationed at Xuancheng, Xu Sheng the magistrate of Wuhu hadarrested one of his officers and recommended that he be executed.
If you punish him, people will surely lose their regard for you."
In the third month on the day rernu [18 Apr] the Grand Tutor Hu Guang died at the age of eighty-two sui.
He wrote also to Yuan Shang, "Metal and wood, water and fire,they complement each other by their very opposition, and they canbe used by men only when they have been brought into harmony.
Then Zhang Yan sent messengers to the capital with a memorial asking to surrender, and he was appointed General of the Household Who Pacifies Disorder and given change of all the affairs of the hills and valleys north of the Yellow River. Every year he was entitled to nominate Filial and Incorrupt candidates and to send in Reporting Officers.
In the twelfth month there was a comet among the Five FeudalPrinces.
Unless he opens his gates and surrenders the city, people will surelybe killed and wounded in the fighting.
He also reported most favourably on the Marquis of Wansui Village, Xun Yu, and in the third month Xun Yu's fief was increased by a thousand households.
LÃ¼ Meng said generously, "Xi Su is a brave man who can offer good service, and he has come a long way to join us. In fairness we should increase his command, not take men away from him."
Sun Quan was besieging Hefei. His forces had surrounded the cityfor a long time, but it did not fall.
Li Fu, announcing himself as Registrar of Ji province,3 asked to seeCao Cao and said, "In this city, the strong oppress the weak and thehearts of the people are troubled and disturbed. I suggest you giveorders for someone who has just surrendered, and who is known andtrusted by the people, to announce your policy."
Li Jue saw the fire north of the River [which had been lit as a signal for the crossing], and he sent riders to scout. Seeing the emperor in midstream, they shouted, "You are taking the emperor away!"
Then LÃ¼ Bu ordered a captain to set up a halberd at the gate ofthe camp. He bent his bow, looked around and said, "You will allsee me shoot at the small spike on that halberd. If I hit it, both sidesdraw back your men. If I miss, then you can stay to settle your quarrel."
"One may fight a hundred battles and be victorious one hundred times, but it is far better to make the other man's soldiers surrender without fighting.
Zhao Wei protested several times, but hisadvice was not heeded, and he too became angry and resentful.
Dong Cheng sent the Prefect of Insignia and Credentials Sun Hui to cut him down in the midst of the crowd. He killed one of the attendants and blood splashed on the Empress' clothes.
Next day, when Yuan Shao learnt that LÃ¼ Bu was still alive, he was so frightened that he closed the gates of the city to protect himself.
Many of the bandits and robbers in the hills and valleys came to join him, his forces grew steadily in numbers till they even reached a million, and they were known as the Black Mountain bandits. All the commanderies north of the Yellow River were exposed to their attacks and the court could do nothing to stop them.
Liu Yu of Guangling, whom Yang Bing had recommended as a Worthy and Good candidate, came to the capital just after his death. He sent in a document saying, "Officials of the palace should not be compared to those who divide the land [in fiefs]. Now, however, they take position alongside the hereditary houses. And they maintain succession to a fief with heirs not from their own body.
"Those wicked servants have many eyes and ears," replied Liu He. "I fear we would suffer misfortune before we could bring our own arrangements together."
Jiang Xu's mother was deeply touched. "Quite right, Boyi!" sheexclaimed. "When Commissioner Wei came to harm, that was alsoyour responsibility, not just Yishan's."What man does not die? And to die for loyalty and for honour,that is something worth while.
In the eleventh month Dong Zhuo was made Chancellor of State, with the right to perform obeisance without calling his own name, to enter court without hastening step, and to stand in the hall of audience with sword and shoes.
But it would be better to die than act dishonourably."
Yuan Tan asked for additional troops,but Shen Pei and the others advised Yuan Shang not to give them tohim.
LiuBei sent the letter to Liu Zhang, saying, "Sun and I are like lips andteeth, but Guan Yu's forces are weak. Unless I go to help him now,Cao Cao will certainly take Jing province, then turn to attack ushere. This danger is more pressing than that from Zhang Lu:
In former times, Gaozu accepted humiliation at Pingcheng, and the Empress Lu disregarded an insolent letter. If you compare that period with the present day, which was the more prosperous?
"Because Cao Cao has clear plans," replied Ju Shou, "and hecontrols the Son of Heaven. Though we have defeated Bogui[Gongsun Zan]8 our soldiers are exhausted, our master is proud andhis officers arrogant. This will bring our army to destruction.
When the libation was complete he would leave his card and depart, and he did not seek to call upon the chief mourners.
Ma Chao had Yan Wen brought below the walls and wanted tomake him tell the people inside that there was no help coming fromthe east.
At this time, the emperor was by the Pond of the Shining Dragon [in the pleasure ground near the Northern Palace].Guan Ba came to report on the question of Li Yun and his supporters.He knelt down and said, "Li Yun is a silly scholar from the country-side, and Du Zhong is a petty official in a commandery. They just got excited and carried away. They're not worth punishing."
In the winter, in the tenth month the Xianlian Qiang raided the Three Adjuncts. Zhang Huan sent his Majors Yin Duan and Dong Zhuo to counter-attack, and they thoroughly defeated them. They cut off the heads of the leaders and captured or killed more than ten thousand others. The three [northern] provinces were peaceful and settled.
Now Zibu [Zhang Zhao] is a worthy man. If I can use him, will his achievements and reputation show credit on anyone but me?"
Li Tong of Jiangxia was the Commandant of Yang'an. Whenhis wife's paternal uncle disobeyed the law Zhao Yan arrested himand sentenced him to death. At this time the final appeal onexecution lay with the Governor or Administrator.51 Li Tong's wifeand children wept and begged for his life,
And the proverb says, 'Cutting off the toes to fit the shoes; who will say that is as stupid as the man who maintains such a fatal policy?'
Here is a danger at the very door of the house. How can you be hesitant about raising troops?"
Dong Zhuo was not pleased, and said, "When you talk that way, are you saying soldiers are useless?"
So he is using sick and weary men to control an army with possible disaffection. Even though he has great numbers, there is nothing to be worried about.
NowI can plan things with him, what difficulties will the empire offer?"He appointed him Master of the Army.
Lu Bu had outposts west of Puyang. Cao Cao attacked them by night and destroyed them.
